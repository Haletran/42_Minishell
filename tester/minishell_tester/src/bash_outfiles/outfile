CHAPTER I.$
Down the Rabbit-Hole$
$
$
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the$
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into$
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or$
conversations in it, M-bM-^@M-^\and what is the use of a book,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice$
M-bM-^@M-^\without pictures or conversations?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the$
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of$
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and$
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran$
close by her.$
$
There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it$
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, M-bM-^@M-^\Oh$
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!M-bM-^@M-^] (when she thought it over afterwards,$
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the$
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a$
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried$
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she$
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a$
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the$
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a$
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.$
$
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how$
in the world she was to get out again.$
$
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then$
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think$
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very$
deep well.$
$
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had$
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what$
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out$
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she$
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with$
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures$
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she$
passed; it was labelled M-bM-^@M-^\ORANGE MARMALADEM-bM-^@M-^], but to her great$
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear$
of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the$
cupboards as she fell past it.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well!M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice to herself, M-bM-^@M-^\after such a fall as this, I shall$
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyM-bM-^@M-^Yll all think me$
at home! Why, I wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt say anything about it, even if I fell off the$
top of the house!M-bM-^@M-^] (Which was very likely true.)$
$
Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? M-bM-^@M-^\I wonder how$
many miles IM-bM-^@M-^Yve fallen by this time?M-bM-^@M-^] she said aloud. M-bM-^@M-^\I must be$
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would$
be four thousand miles down, I thinkM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] (for, you see, Alice had learnt$
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and$
though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her$
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good$
practice to say it over) M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tyes, thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys about the right distanceM-bM-^@M-^Tbut$
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude IM-bM-^@M-^Yve got to?M-bM-^@M-^] (Alice had no$
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice$
grand words to say.)$
$
Presently she began again. M-bM-^@M-^\I wonder if I shall fall right _through_$
the earth! How funny itM-bM-^@M-^Yll seem to come out among the people that walk$
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] (she was rather$
glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt sound at all$
the right word) M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tbut I shall have to ask them what the name of the$
country is, you know. Please, MaM-bM-^@M-^Yam, is this New Zealand or Australia?M-bM-^@M-^]$
(and she tried to curtsey as she spokeM-bM-^@M-^Tfancy _curtseying_ as youM-bM-^@M-^Yre$
falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) M-bM-^@M-^\And what$
an ignorant little girl sheM-bM-^@M-^Yll think me for asking! No, itM-bM-^@M-^Yll never do$
to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began$
talking again. M-bM-^@M-^\DinahM-bM-^@M-^Yll miss me very much to-night, I should think!M-bM-^@M-^]$
(Dinah was the cat.) M-bM-^@M-^\I hope theyM-bM-^@M-^Yll remember her saucer of milk at$
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are$
no mice in the air, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?M-bM-^@M-^] And here$
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a$
dreamy sort of way, M-bM-^@M-^\Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?M-bM-^@M-^] and$
sometimes, M-bM-^@M-^\Do bats eat cats?M-bM-^@M-^] for, you see, as she couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt answer$
either question, it didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt much matter which way she put it. She felt$
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was$
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,$
M-bM-^@M-^\Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?M-bM-^@M-^] when suddenly,$
thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and$
the fall was over.$
$
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:$
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another$
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down$
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,$
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, M-bM-^@M-^\Oh my ears$
and whiskers, how late itM-bM-^@M-^Ys getting!M-bM-^@M-^] She was close behind it when she$
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found$
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging$
from the roof.$
$
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when$
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every$
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to$
get out again.$
$
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid$
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and AliceM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;$
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,$
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second$
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and$
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the$
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!$
$
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not$
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the$
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get$
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright$
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head$
through the doorway; M-bM-^@M-^\and even if my head would go through,M-bM-^@M-^] thought$
poor Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,$
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only$
knew how to begin.M-bM-^@M-^] For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had$
happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things$
indeed were really impossible.$
$
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went$
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at$
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this$
time she found a little bottle on it, (M-bM-^@M-^\which certainly was not here$
before,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper$
label, with the words M-bM-^@M-^\DRINK ME,M-bM-^@M-^] beautifully printed on it in large$
letters.$
$
It was all very well to say M-bM-^@M-^\Drink me,M-bM-^@M-^] but the wise little Alice was$
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. M-bM-^@M-^\No, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll look first,M-bM-^@M-^] she said,$
M-bM-^@M-^\and see whether itM-bM-^@M-^Ys marked M-bM-^@M-^X_poison_M-bM-^@M-^Y or notM-bM-^@M-^]; for she had read$
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and$
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they$
_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:$
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;$
and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually$
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a$
bottle marked M-bM-^@M-^\poison,M-bM-^@M-^] it is almost certain to disagree with you,$
sooner or later.$
$
However, this bottle was _not_ marked M-bM-^@M-^\poison,M-bM-^@M-^] so Alice ventured to$
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed$
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and$
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.$
$

$

$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What a curious feeling!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\I must be shutting up like a$
telescope.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face$
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going$
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she$
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:$
she felt a little nervous about this; M-bM-^@M-^\for it might end, you know,M-bM-^@M-^]$
said Alice to herself, M-bM-^@M-^\in my going out altogether, like a candle. I$
wonder what I should be like then?M-bM-^@M-^] And she tried to fancy what the$
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could$
not remember ever having seen such a thing.$
$
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going$
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the$
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she$
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach$
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her$
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;$
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing$
sat down and cried.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Come, thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no use in crying like that!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice to herself,$
rather sharply; M-bM-^@M-^\I advise you to leave off this minute!M-bM-^@M-^] She generally$
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),$
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into$
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having$
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,$
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.$
M-bM-^@M-^\But itM-bM-^@M-^Ys no use now,M-bM-^@M-^] thought poor Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\to pretend to be two$
people! Why, thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable$
person!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:$
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words$
M-bM-^@M-^\EAT MEM-bM-^@M-^] were beautifully marked in currants. M-bM-^@M-^\Well, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll eat it,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it$
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way IM-bM-^@M-^Yll$
get into the garden, and I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt care which happens!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, M-bM-^@M-^\Which way? Which$
way?M-bM-^@M-^], holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was$
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same$
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice$
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way$
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go$
on in the common way.$
$
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.$

CHAPTER II.$
The Pool of Tears$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Curiouser and curiouser!M-bM-^@M-^] cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that$
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); M-bM-^@M-^\now IM-bM-^@M-^Ym$
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!M-bM-^@M-^]$
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of$
sight, they were getting so far off). M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, my poor little feet, I$
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? IM-bM-^@M-^Ym$
sure _I_ shanM-bM-^@M-^Yt be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble$
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;M-bM-^@M-^Tbut I must be$
kind to them,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\or perhaps they wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt walk the way I$
want to go! Let me see: IM-bM-^@M-^Yll give them a new pair of boots every$
Christmas.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. M-bM-^@M-^\They must$
go by the carrier,M-bM-^@M-^] she thought; M-bM-^@M-^\and how funny itM-bM-^@M-^Yll seem, sending$
presents to oneM-bM-^@M-^Ys own feet! And how odd the directions will look!$
$
     _AliceM-bM-^@M-^Ys Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with$
     AliceM-bM-^@M-^Ys love_).$
$
Oh dear, what nonsense IM-bM-^@M-^Ym talking!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was$
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden$
key and hurried off to the garden door.$
$
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to$
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more$
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You ought to be ashamed of yourself,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\a great girl like$
you,M-bM-^@M-^] (she might well say this), M-bM-^@M-^\to go on crying in this way! Stop$
this moment, I tell you!M-bM-^@M-^] But she went on all the same, shedding$
gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about$
four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.$
$
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and$
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White$
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves$
in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a$
great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, M-bM-^@M-^\Oh! the Duchess, the$
Duchess! Oh! wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt she be savage if IM-bM-^@M-^Yve kept her waiting!M-bM-^@M-^] Alice felt$
so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the$
Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, M-bM-^@M-^\If you please,$
sirM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and$
the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.$
$
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she$
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: M-bM-^@M-^\Dear, dear! How$
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.$
I wonder if IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the$
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling$
a little different. But if IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not the same, the next question is, Who$
in the world am I? Ah, _thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys_ the great puzzle!M-bM-^@M-^] And she began$
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as$
herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sure IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not Ada,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, M-bM-^@M-^\for her hair goes in such long$
ringlets, and mine doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt go in ringlets at all; and IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sure I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a$
very little! Besides, _sheM-bM-^@M-^Ys_ she, and _IM-bM-^@M-^Ym_ I, andM-bM-^@M-^Toh dear, how$
puzzling it all is! IM-bM-^@M-^Yll try if I know all the things I used to know.$
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,$
and four times seven isM-bM-^@M-^Toh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that$
rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt signify: letM-bM-^@M-^Ys try$
Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of$
Rome, and RomeM-bM-^@M-^Tno, _thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys_ all wrong, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym certain! I must have been$
changed for Mabel! IM-bM-^@M-^Yll try and say M-bM-^@M-^X_How doth the little_M-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^] and she$
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began$
to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words$
did not come the same as they used to do:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How doth the little crocodile$
    Improve his shining tail,$
And pour the waters of the Nile$
    On every golden scale!$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How cheerfully he seems to grin,$
    How neatly spread his claws,$
And welcome little fishes in$
    With gently smiling jaws!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sure those are not the right words,M-bM-^@M-^] said poor Alice, and her eyes$
filled with tears again as she went on, M-bM-^@M-^\I must be Mabel after all, and$
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to$
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, IM-bM-^@M-^Yve$
made up my mind about it; if IM-bM-^@M-^Ym Mabel, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll stay down here! ItM-bM-^@M-^Yll be$
no use their putting their heads down and saying M-bM-^@M-^XCome up again, dear!M-bM-^@M-^Y$
I shall only look up and say M-bM-^@M-^XWho am I then? Tell me that first, and$
then, if I like being that person, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll come up: if not, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll stay down$
here till IM-bM-^@M-^Ym somebody elseM-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^Tbut, oh dear!M-bM-^@M-^] cried Alice, with a sudden$
burst of tears, M-bM-^@M-^\I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so$
_very_ tired of being all alone here!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see$
that she had put on one of the RabbitM-bM-^@M-^Ys little white kid gloves while$
she was talking. M-bM-^@M-^\How _can_ I have done that?M-bM-^@M-^] she thought. M-bM-^@M-^\I must be$
growing small again.M-bM-^@M-^] She got up and went to the table to measure$
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was$
now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon$
found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she$
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That _was_ a narrow escape!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, a good deal frightened at the$
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; M-bM-^@M-^\and$
now for the garden!M-bM-^@M-^] and she ran with all speed back to the little$
door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden$
key was lying on the glass table as before, M-bM-^@M-^\and things are worse than$
ever,M-bM-^@M-^] thought the poor child, M-bM-^@M-^\for I never was so small as this$
before, never! And I declare itM-bM-^@M-^Ys too bad, that it is!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,$
splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that$
she had somehow fallen into the sea, M-bM-^@M-^\and in that case I can go back by$
railway,M-bM-^@M-^] she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in$
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go$
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the$
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row$
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she$
soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when$
she was nine feet high.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wish I hadnM-bM-^@M-^Yt cried so much!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, as she swam about, trying$
to find her way out. M-bM-^@M-^\I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by$
being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be$
sure! However, everything is queer to-day.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way$
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought$
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small$
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had$
slipped in like herself.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Would it be of any use, now,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\to speak to this mouse?$
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very$
likely it can talk: at any rate, thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no harm in trying.M-bM-^@M-^] So she$
began: M-bM-^@M-^\O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired$
of swimming about here, O Mouse!M-bM-^@M-^] (Alice thought this must be the right$
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but$
she remembered having seen in her brotherM-bM-^@M-^Ys Latin Grammar, M-bM-^@M-^\A mouseM-bM-^@M-^Tof$
a mouseM-bM-^@M-^Tto a mouseM-bM-^@M-^Ta mouseM-bM-^@M-^TO mouse!M-bM-^@M-^]) The Mouse looked at her rather$
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,$
but it said nothing.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Perhaps it doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt understand English,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\I daresay itM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.M-bM-^@M-^] (For, with all$
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago$
anything had happened.) So she began again: M-bM-^@M-^\OM-CM-9 est ma chatte?M-bM-^@M-^] which$
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a$
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with$
fright. M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, I beg your pardon!M-bM-^@M-^] cried Alice hastily, afraid that she$
had hurt the poor animalM-bM-^@M-^Ys feelings. M-bM-^@M-^\I quite forgot you didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt like$
cats.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not like cats!M-bM-^@M-^] cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. M-bM-^@M-^\Would$
_you_ like cats if you were me?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, perhaps not,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice in a soothing tone: M-bM-^@M-^\donM-bM-^@M-^Yt be angry$
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think youM-bM-^@M-^Yd$
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear$
quiet thing,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about$
in the pool, M-bM-^@M-^\and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her$
paws and washing her faceM-bM-^@M-^Tand she is such a nice soft thing to$
nurseM-bM-^@M-^Tand sheM-bM-^@M-^Ys such a capital one for catching miceM-bM-^@M-^Toh, I beg your$
pardon!M-bM-^@M-^] cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all$
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. M-bM-^@M-^\We wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt talk$
about her any more if youM-bM-^@M-^Yd rather not.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We indeed!M-bM-^@M-^] cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his$
tail. M-bM-^@M-^\As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always$
_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt let me hear the name$
again!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt indeed!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of$
conversation. M-bM-^@M-^\Are youM-bM-^@M-^Tare you fondM-bM-^@M-^TofM-bM-^@M-^Tof dogs?M-bM-^@M-^] The Mouse did not$
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: M-bM-^@M-^\There is such a nice little dog near$
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you$
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And itM-bM-^@M-^Yll fetch things when$
you throw them, and itM-bM-^@M-^Yll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts$
of thingsM-bM-^@M-^TI canM-bM-^@M-^Yt remember half of themM-bM-^@M-^Tand it belongs to a farmer, you$
know, and he says itM-bM-^@M-^Ys so useful, itM-bM-^@M-^Ys worth a hundred pounds! He says$
it kills all the rats andM-bM-^@M-^Toh dear!M-bM-^@M-^] cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym afraid IM-bM-^@M-^Yve offended it again!M-bM-^@M-^] For the Mouse was swimming away$
from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the$
pool as it went.$
$
So she called softly after it, M-bM-^@M-^\Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we$
wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt talk about cats or dogs either, if you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt like them!M-bM-^@M-^] When the$
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face$
was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low$
trembling voice, M-bM-^@M-^\Let us get to the shore, and then IM-bM-^@M-^Yll tell you my$
history, and youM-bM-^@M-^Yll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the$
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a$
Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice$
led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.$
$
$
$
$
CHAPTER III.$
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale$
$
$
They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bankM-bM-^@M-^Tthe$
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close$
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.$
$
The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a$
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite$
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if$
she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument$
with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, M-bM-^@M-^\I am$
older than you, and must know better;M-bM-^@M-^] and this Alice would not allow$
without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to$
tell its age, there was no more to be said.$
$
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,$
called out, M-bM-^@M-^\Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _IM-bM-^@M-^Yll_ soon make$
you dry enough!M-bM-^@M-^] They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the$
Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she$
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ahem!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mouse with an important air, M-bM-^@M-^\are you all ready? This$
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! M-bM-^@M-^XWilliam$
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted$
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much$
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of$
Mercia and NorthumbriaM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ugh!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Lory, with a shiver.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I beg your pardon!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: M-bM-^@M-^\Did$
you speak?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not I!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Lory hastily.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I thought you did,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mouse. M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^TI proceed. M-bM-^@M-^XEdwin and Morcar,$
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even$
Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisableM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Found _what_?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duck.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Found _it_,M-bM-^@M-^] the Mouse replied rather crossly: M-bM-^@M-^\of course you know$
what M-bM-^@M-^XitM-bM-^@M-^Y means.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know what M-bM-^@M-^XitM-bM-^@M-^Y means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,M-bM-^@M-^] said the$
Duck: M-bM-^@M-^\itM-bM-^@M-^Ys generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the$
archbishop find?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^XM-bM-^@M-^Tfound$
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him$
the crown. WilliamM-bM-^@M-^Ys conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence$
of his NormansM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^Y How are you getting on now, my dear?M-bM-^@M-^] it continued,$
turning to Alice as it spoke.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\As wet as ever,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice in a melancholy tone: M-bM-^@M-^\it doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt seem to$
dry me at all.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In that case,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, M-bM-^@M-^\I move$
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic$
remediesM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Speak English!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Eaglet. M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know the meaning of half$
those long words, and, whatM-bM-^@M-^Ys more, I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt believe you do either!M-bM-^@M-^] And$
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds$
tittered audibly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What I was going to say,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dodo in an offended tone, M-bM-^@M-^\was,$
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What _is_ a Caucus-race?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice; not that she wanted much to$
know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to$
speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dodo, M-bM-^@M-^\the best way to explain it is to do it.M-bM-^@M-^] (And,$
as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will$
tell you how the Dodo managed it.)$
$
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (M-bM-^@M-^\the exact$
shape doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt matter,M-bM-^@M-^] it said,) and then all the party were placed$
along the course, here and there. There was no M-bM-^@M-^\One, two, three, and$
away,M-bM-^@M-^] but they began running when they liked, and left off when they$
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,$
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry$
again, the Dodo suddenly called out M-bM-^@M-^\The race is over!M-bM-^@M-^] and they all$
crowded round it, panting, and asking, M-bM-^@M-^\But who has won?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of$
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its$
forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the$
pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo$
said, M-bM-^@M-^\_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But who is to give the prizes?M-bM-^@M-^] quite a chorus of voices asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why, _she_, of course,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one$
finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a$
confused way, M-bM-^@M-^\Prizes! Prizes!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her$
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had$
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly$
one a-piece, all round.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But she must have a prize herself, you know,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mouse.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course,M-bM-^@M-^] the Dodo replied very gravely. M-bM-^@M-^\What else have you got in$
your pocket?M-bM-^@M-^] he went on, turning to Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Only a thimble,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice sadly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Hand it over here,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dodo.$
$
Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly$
presented the thimble, saying M-bM-^@M-^\We beg your acceptance of this elegant$
thimble;M-bM-^@M-^] and, when it had finished this short speech, they all$
cheered.$
$
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave$
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything$
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as$
she could.$
$
The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and$
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste$
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.$
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and$
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You promised to tell me your history, you know,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\and why$
it is you hateM-bM-^@M-^TC and D,M-bM-^@M-^] she added in a whisper, half afraid that it$
would be offended again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mine is a long and a sad tale!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and$
sighing.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It _is_ a long tail, certainly,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, looking down with wonder$
at the MouseM-bM-^@M-^Ys tail; M-bM-^@M-^\but why do you call it sad?M-bM-^@M-^] And she kept on$
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the$
tale was something like this:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
         M-bM-^@M-^\Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, M-bM-^@M-^XLet us both$
         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.M-bM-^@M-^TCome, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll take no$
         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning IM-bM-^@M-^Yve$
         nothing to do.M-bM-^@M-^Y Said the mouse to the cur, M-bM-^@M-^XSuch a trial, dear$
         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.M-bM-^@M-^Y$
         M-bM-^@M-^XIM-bM-^@M-^Yll be judge, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll be jury,M-bM-^@M-^Y Said cunning old Fury: M-bM-^@M-^XIM-bM-^@M-^Yll$
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You are not attending!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mouse to Alice severely. M-bM-^@M-^\What are$
you thinking of?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I beg your pardon,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice very humbly: M-bM-^@M-^\you had got to the fifth$
bend, I think?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I had _not!_M-bM-^@M-^] cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A knot!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking$
anxiously about her. M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, do let me help to undo it!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I shall do nothing of the sort,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mouse, getting up and$
walking away. M-bM-^@M-^\You insult me by talking such nonsense!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt mean it!M-bM-^@M-^] pleaded poor Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\But youM-bM-^@M-^Yre so easily offended,$
you know!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Mouse only growled in reply.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Please come back and finish your story!M-bM-^@M-^] Alice called after it; and$
the others all joined in chorus, M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, please do!M-bM-^@M-^] but the Mouse only$
shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What a pity it wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt stay!M-bM-^@M-^] sighed the Lory, as soon as it was$
quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to$
her daughter M-bM-^@M-^\Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose$
_your_ temper!M-bM-^@M-^] M-bM-^@M-^\Hold your tongue, Ma!M-bM-^@M-^] said the young Crab, a little$
snappishly. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre enough to try the patience of an oyster!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice aloud,$
addressing nobody in particular. M-bM-^@M-^\SheM-bM-^@M-^Yd soon fetch it back!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?M-bM-^@M-^] said the$
Lory.$
$
Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:$
M-bM-^@M-^\DinahM-bM-^@M-^Ys our cat. And sheM-bM-^@M-^Ys such a capital one for catching mice you$
canM-bM-^@M-^Yt think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,$
sheM-bM-^@M-^Yll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the$
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very$
carefully, remarking, M-bM-^@M-^\I really must be getting home; the night-air$
doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt suit my throat!M-bM-^@M-^] and a Canary called out in a trembling voice$
to its children, M-bM-^@M-^\Come away, my dears! ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys high time you were all in$
bed!M-bM-^@M-^] On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left$
alone.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wish I hadnM-bM-^@M-^Yt mentioned Dinah!M-bM-^@M-^] she said to herself in a melancholy$
tone. M-bM-^@M-^\Nobody seems to like her, down here, and IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sure sheM-bM-^@M-^Ys the best$
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you$
any more!M-bM-^@M-^] And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very$
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a$
little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up$
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was$
coming back to finish his story.$
$
$
$
$
CHAPTER IV.$
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill$
$
$
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking$
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard$
it muttering to itself M-bM-^@M-^\The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh$
my fur and whiskers! SheM-bM-^@M-^Yll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are$
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?M-bM-^@M-^] Alice guessed in a$
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid$
gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but$
they were nowhere to be seenM-bM-^@M-^Teverything seemed to have changed since$
her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the$
little door, had vanished completely.$
$
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and$
called out to her in an angry tone, M-bM-^@M-^\Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you$
doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and$
a fan! Quick, now!M-bM-^@M-^] And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off$
at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the$
mistake it had made.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He took me for his housemaid,M-bM-^@M-^] she said to herself as she ran. M-bM-^@M-^\How$
surprised heM-bM-^@M-^Yll be when he finds out who I am! But IM-bM-^@M-^Yd better take him$
his fan and glovesM-bM-^@M-^Tthat is, if I can find them.M-bM-^@M-^] As she said this, she$
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass$
plate with the name M-bM-^@M-^\W. RABBIT,M-bM-^@M-^] engraved upon it. She went in without$
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the$
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the$
fan and gloves.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How queer it seems,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice said to herself, M-bM-^@M-^\to be going messages for$
a rabbit! I suppose DinahM-bM-^@M-^Yll be sending me on messages next!M-bM-^@M-^] And she$
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^XMiss Alice! Come$
here directly, and get ready for your walk!M-bM-^@M-^Y M-bM-^@M-^XComing in a minute,$
nurse! But IM-bM-^@M-^Yve got to see that the mouse doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt get out.M-bM-^@M-^Y Only I$
donM-bM-^@M-^Yt think,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice went on, M-bM-^@M-^\that theyM-bM-^@M-^Yd let Dinah stop in the house$
if it began ordering people about like that!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table$
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three$
pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the$
gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a$
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label$
this time with the words M-bM-^@M-^\DRINK ME,M-bM-^@M-^] but nevertheless she uncorked it$
and put it to her lips. M-bM-^@M-^\I know _something_ interesting is sure to$
happen,M-bM-^@M-^] she said to herself, M-bM-^@M-^\whenever I eat or drink anything; so$
IM-bM-^@M-^Yll just see what this bottle does. I do hope itM-bM-^@M-^Yll make me grow large$
again, for really IM-bM-^@M-^Ym quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had$
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,$
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put$
down the bottle, saying to herself M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys quite enoughM-bM-^@M-^TI hope I shanM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
grow any moreM-bM-^@M-^TAs it is, I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt get out at the doorM-bM-^@M-^TI do wish I hadnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
drunk quite so much!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,$
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there$
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with$
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.$
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out$
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself M-bM-^@M-^\Now I$
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,$
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there$
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room$
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It was much pleasanter at home,M-bM-^@M-^] thought poor Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\when one wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and$
rabbits. I almost wish I hadnM-bM-^@M-^Yt gone down that rabbit-holeM-bM-^@M-^Tand yetM-bM-^@M-^Tand$
yetM-bM-^@M-^TitM-bM-^@M-^Ys rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what$
_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied$
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of$
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And$
when I grow up, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll write oneM-bM-^@M-^Tbut IM-bM-^@M-^Ym grown up now,M-bM-^@M-^] she added in a$
sorrowful tone; M-bM-^@M-^\at least thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no room to grow up any more _here_.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But then,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\shall I _never_ get any older than I am$
now? ThatM-bM-^@M-^Yll be a comfort, one wayM-bM-^@M-^Tnever to be an old womanM-bM-^@M-^Tbut$
thenM-bM-^@M-^Talways to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt like _that!_M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, you foolish Alice!M-bM-^@M-^] she answered herself. M-bM-^@M-^\How can you learn$
lessons in here? Why, thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys hardly room for _you_, and no room at all$
for any lesson-books!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and$
making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes$
she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mary Ann! Mary Ann!M-bM-^@M-^] said the voice. M-bM-^@M-^\Fetch me my gloves this moment!M-bM-^@M-^]$
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was$
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the$
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as$
large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.$
$
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as$
the door opened inwards, and AliceM-bM-^@M-^Ys elbow was pressed hard against it,$
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself M-bM-^@M-^\Then IM-bM-^@M-^Yll$
go round and get in at the window.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_That_ you wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt!M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied$
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her$
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,$
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,$
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a$
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.$
$
Next came an angry voiceM-bM-^@M-^Tthe RabbitM-bM-^@M-^YsM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\Pat! Pat! Where are you?M-bM-^@M-^] And$
then a voice she had never heard before, M-bM-^@M-^\Sure then IM-bM-^@M-^Ym here! Digging$
for apples, yer honour!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Digging for apples, indeed!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Rabbit angrily. M-bM-^@M-^\Here! Come and$
help me out of _this!_M-bM-^@M-^] (Sounds of more broken glass.)$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Now tell me, Pat, whatM-bM-^@M-^Ys that in the window?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sure, itM-bM-^@M-^Ys an arm, yer honour!M-bM-^@M-^] (He pronounced it M-bM-^@M-^\arrum.M-bM-^@M-^])$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole$
window!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sure, it does, yer honour: but itM-bM-^@M-^Ys an arm for all that.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, itM-bM-^@M-^Ys got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers$
now and then; such as, M-bM-^@M-^\Sure, I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt like it, yer honour, at all, at$
all!M-bM-^@M-^] M-bM-^@M-^\Do as I tell you, you coward!M-bM-^@M-^] and at last she spread out her$
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were$
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. M-bM-^@M-^\What a number$
of cucumber-frames there must be!M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\I wonder what$
theyM-bM-^@M-^Yll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they$
_could!_ IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sure _I_ donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want to stay in here any longer!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a$
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all$
talking together: she made out the words: M-bM-^@M-^\WhereM-bM-^@M-^Ys the other$
ladder?M-bM-^@M-^TWhy, I hadnM-bM-^@M-^Yt to bring but one; BillM-bM-^@M-^Ys got the otherM-bM-^@M-^TBill!$

Heads below!M-bM-^@M-^] (a loud crash)M-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\Now, who did that?M-bM-^@M-^TIt was Bill, I$
fancyM-bM-^@M-^TWhoM-bM-^@M-^Ys to go down the chimney?M-bM-^@M-^TNay, _I_ shanM-bM-^@M-^Yt! _You_ do$
it!M-bM-^@M-^T_That_ I wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt, then!M-bM-^@M-^TBillM-bM-^@M-^Ys to go downM-bM-^@M-^THere, Bill! the master says$
youM-bM-^@M-^Yre to go down the chimney!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh! So BillM-bM-^@M-^Ys got to come down the chimney, has he?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice to$
herself. M-bM-^@M-^\Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt be in$
BillM-bM-^@M-^Ys place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but$
I _think_ I can kick a little!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till$
she heard a little animal (she couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt guess of what sort it was)$
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,$
saying to herself M-bM-^@M-^\This is Bill,M-bM-^@M-^] she gave one sharp kick, and waited$
to see what would happen next.$
$
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of M-bM-^@M-^\There goes Bill!M-bM-^@M-^]$
then the RabbitM-bM-^@M-^Ys voice alongM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\Catch him, you by the hedge!M-bM-^@M-^] then$
silence, and then another confusion of voicesM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\Hold up his headM-bM-^@M-^TBrandy$
nowM-bM-^@M-^TDonM-bM-^@M-^Yt choke himM-bM-^@M-^THow was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell$
us all about it!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys Bill,M-bM-^@M-^] thought$
Alice,) M-bM-^@M-^\Well, I hardly knowM-bM-^@M-^TNo more, thank ye; IM-bM-^@M-^Ym better nowM-bM-^@M-^Tbut IM-bM-^@M-^Ym$
a deal too flustered to tell youM-bM-^@M-^Tall I know is, something comes at me$
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\So you did, old fellow!M-bM-^@M-^] said the others.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We must burn the house down!M-bM-^@M-^] said the RabbitM-bM-^@M-^Ys voice; and Alice$
called out as loud as she could, M-bM-^@M-^\If you do, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll set Dinah at you!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, M-bM-^@M-^\I$
wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, theyM-bM-^@M-^Yd take the$
roof off.M-bM-^@M-^] After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and$
Alice heard the Rabbit say, M-bM-^@M-^\A barrowful will do, to begin with.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A barrowful of _what?_M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,$
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the$
window, and some of them hit her in the face. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll put a stop to$
this,M-bM-^@M-^] she said to herself, and shouted out, M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yd better not do that$
again!M-bM-^@M-^] which produced another dead silence.$
$
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into$
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her$
head. M-bM-^@M-^\If I eat one of these cakes,M-bM-^@M-^] she thought, M-bM-^@M-^\itM-bM-^@M-^Ys sure to make$
_some_ change in my size; and as it canM-bM-^@M-^Yt possibly make me larger, it$
must make me smaller, I suppose.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she$
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get$
through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of$
little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,$
was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it$
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she$
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself$
safe in a thick wood.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The first thing IM-bM-^@M-^Yve got to do,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice to herself, as she$
wandered about in the wood, M-bM-^@M-^\is to grow to my right size again; and the$
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that$
will be the best plan.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply$
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea$
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among$
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a$
great hurry.$
$
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and$
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. M-bM-^@M-^\Poor little$
thing!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to$
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it$
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in$
spite of all her coaxing.$
$
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and$
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off$
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,$
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,$
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the$
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head$
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was$
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every$
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then$
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very$
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely$
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with$
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.$
$
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she$
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,$
and till the puppyM-bM-^@M-^Ys bark sounded quite faint in the distance.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And yet what a dear little puppy it was!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, as she leant$
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the$
leaves: M-bM-^@M-^\I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifM-bM-^@M-^Tif IM-bM-^@M-^Yd$
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! IM-bM-^@M-^Yd nearly forgotten that$
IM-bM-^@M-^Yve got to grow up again! Let me seeM-bM-^@M-^Thow _is_ it to be managed? I$
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great$
question is, what?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at$
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that$
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.$
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as$
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and$
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what$
was on the top of it.$
$
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the$
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue$
caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly$
smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of$
anything else.$
$
$
$
$
CHAPTER V.$
Advice from a Caterpillar$
$
$
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in$
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and$
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Who are _you?_M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,$
rather shyly, M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^TI hardly know, sir, just at presentM-bM-^@M-^Tat least I know$
who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been$
changed several times since then.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What do you mean by that?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar sternly. M-bM-^@M-^\Explain$
yourself!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt explain _myself_, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym afraid, sir,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\because IM-bM-^@M-^Ym$
not myself, you see.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt see,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym afraid I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt put it more clearly,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice replied very politely,$
M-bM-^@M-^\for I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt understand it myself to begin with; and being so many$
different sizes in a day is very confusing.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, perhaps you havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt found it so yet,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\but when you$
have to turn into a chrysalisM-bM-^@M-^Tyou will some day, you knowM-bM-^@M-^Tand then$
after that into a butterfly, I should think youM-bM-^@M-^Yll feel it a little$
queer, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not a bit,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\all I know$
is, it would feel very queer to _me_.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar contemptuously. M-bM-^@M-^\Who are _you?_M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.$
Alice felt a little irritated at the CaterpillarM-bM-^@M-^Ys making such _very_$
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, M-bM-^@M-^\I$
think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any$
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant$
state of mind, she turned away.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Come back!M-bM-^@M-^] the Caterpillar called after her. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve something$
important to say!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Keep your temper,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Is that all?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she$
could.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,$
and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For$
some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded$
its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, M-bM-^@M-^\So you$
think youM-bM-^@M-^Yre changed, do you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym afraid I am, sir,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt remember things as I$
usedM-bM-^@M-^Tand I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt keep the same size for ten minutes together!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\CanM-bM-^@M-^Yt remember _what_ things?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, IM-bM-^@M-^Yve tried to say M-bM-^@M-^\How doth the little busy bee,M-bM-^@M-^] but it all$
came different!M-bM-^@M-^] Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Repeat, M-bM-^@M-^\_You are old, Father William_,M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
Alice folded her hands, and began:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You are old, Father William,M-bM-^@M-^] the young man said,$
    M-bM-^@M-^\And your hair has become very white;$
And yet you incessantly stand on your headM-bM-^@M-^T$
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In my youth,M-bM-^@M-^] Father William replied to his son,$
    M-bM-^@M-^\I feared it might injure the brain;$
But, now that IM-bM-^@M-^Ym perfectly sure I have none,$
    Why, I do it again and again.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You are old,M-bM-^@M-^] said the youth, M-bM-^@M-^\as I mentioned before,$
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;$
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the doorM-bM-^@M-^T$
    Pray, what is the reason of that?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In my youth,M-bM-^@M-^] said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,$
    M-bM-^@M-^\I kept all my limbs very supple$
By the use of this ointmentM-bM-^@M-^Tone shilling the boxM-bM-^@M-^T$
    Allow me to sell you a couple?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You are old,M-bM-^@M-^] said the youth, M-bM-^@M-^\and your jaws are too weak$
    For anything tougher than suet;$
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beakM-bM-^@M-^T$
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In my youth,M-bM-^@M-^] said his father, M-bM-^@M-^\I took to the law,$
    And argued each case with my wife;$
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,$
    Has lasted the rest of my life.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You are old,M-bM-^@M-^] said the youth, M-bM-^@M-^\one would hardly suppose$
    That your eye was as steady as ever;$
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your noseM-bM-^@M-^T$
    What made you so awfully clever?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have answered three questions, and that is enough,M-bM-^@M-^]$
    Said his father; M-bM-^@M-^\donM-bM-^@M-^Yt give yourself airs!$
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?$
    Be off, or IM-bM-^@M-^Yll kick you down stairs!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is not said right,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not _quite_ right, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym afraid,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, timidly; M-bM-^@M-^\some of the$
words have got altered.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is wrong from beginning to end,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar decidedly,$
and there was silence for some minutes.$
$
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What size do you want to be?M-bM-^@M-^] it asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not particular as to size,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice hastily replied; M-bM-^@M-^\only one$
doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt like changing so often, you know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I _donM-bM-^@M-^Yt_ know,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life$
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Are you content now?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
mind,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice: M-bM-^@M-^\three inches is such a wretched height to be.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is a very good height indeed!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar angrily,$
rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not used to it!M-bM-^@M-^] pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she$
thought of herself, M-bM-^@M-^\I wish the creatures wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt be so easily$
offended!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yll get used to it in time,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar; and it put the$
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.$
$
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a$
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and$
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the$
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,$
M-bM-^@M-^\One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you$
grow shorter.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice to$
herself.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of the mushroom,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it$
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.$
$
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,$
trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was$
perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at$
last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke$
off a bit of the edge with each hand.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And now which is which?M-bM-^@M-^] she said to herself, and nibbled a little of$
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a$
violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!$
$
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt$
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she$
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed$
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her$
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the$
lefthand bit.$
$
*      *      *      *      *      *      *$
$
    *      *      *      *      *      *$
$
*      *      *      *      *      *      *$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Come, my headM-bM-^@M-^Ys free at last!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice in a tone of delight, which$
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders$
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was$
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a$
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What _can_ all that green stuff be?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\And where _have_ my$
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt see you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,$
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.$
$
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,$
she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that$
her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She$
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was$
going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but$
the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp$
hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her$
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Serpent!M-bM-^@M-^] screamed the Pigeon.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym _not_ a serpent!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice indignantly. M-bM-^@M-^\Let me alone!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Serpent, I say again!M-bM-^@M-^] repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued$
tone, and added with a kind of sob, M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve tried every way, and nothing$
seems to suit them!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt the least idea what youM-bM-^@M-^Yre talking about,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve tried the roots of trees, and IM-bM-^@M-^Yve tried banks, and IM-bM-^@M-^Yve tried$
hedges,M-bM-^@M-^] the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; M-bM-^@M-^\but those$
serpents! ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no pleasing them!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in$
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\As if it wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt trouble enough hatching the eggs,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Pigeon;$
M-bM-^@M-^\but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I$
havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt had a wink of sleep these three weeks!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym very sorry youM-bM-^@M-^Yve been annoyed,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, who was beginning to$
see its meaning.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And just as IM-bM-^@M-^Yd taken the highest tree in the wood,M-bM-^@M-^] continued the$
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, M-bM-^@M-^\and just as I was thinking I$
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down$
from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But IM-bM-^@M-^Ym _not_ a serpent, I tell you!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym aM-bM-^@M-^TIM-bM-^@M-^Ym aM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well! _What_ are you?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Pigeon. M-bM-^@M-^\I can see youM-bM-^@M-^Yre trying to$
invent something!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^TIM-bM-^@M-^Ym a little girl,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered$
the number of changes she had gone through that day.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A likely story indeed!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest$
contempt. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never$
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre a serpent; and thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
no use denying it. I suppose youM-bM-^@M-^Yll be telling me next that you never$
tasted an egg!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, who was a very truthful$
child; M-bM-^@M-^\but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you$
know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt believe it,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Pigeon; M-bM-^@M-^\but if they do, why then$
theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre a kind of serpent, thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys all I can say.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a$
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre$
looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to$
me whether youM-bM-^@M-^Yre a little girl or a serpent?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It matters a good deal to _me_,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice hastily; M-bM-^@M-^\but IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not$
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt want$
_yours_: I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt like them raw.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, be off, then!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled$
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well$
as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,$
and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while$
she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,$
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at$
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until$
she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.$
$
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it$
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,$
and began talking to herself, as usual. M-bM-^@M-^\Come, thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys half my plan$
done now! How puzzling all these changes are! IM-bM-^@M-^Ym never sure what IM-bM-^@M-^Ym$
going to be, from one minute to another! However, IM-bM-^@M-^Yve got back to my$
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenM-bM-^@M-^Thow$
_is_ that to be done, I wonder?M-bM-^@M-^] As she said this, she came suddenly$
upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.$
M-bM-^@M-^\Whoever lives there,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\itM-bM-^@M-^Yll never do to come upon them$
_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!M-bM-^@M-^] So she$
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go$
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.$
$
$
$
$
CHAPTER VI.$
Pig and Pepper$
$
$
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what$
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the$
woodM-bM-^@M-^T(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:$
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a$
fish)M-bM-^@M-^Tand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by$
another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a$
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled$
all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all$
about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.$
$
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,$
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,$
saying, in a solemn tone, M-bM-^@M-^\For the Duchess. An invitation from the$
Queen to play croquet.M-bM-^@M-^] The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn$
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, M-bM-^@M-^\From the Queen.$
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.$
$
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood$
for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the$
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the$
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.$
$
Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no sort of use in knocking,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Footman, M-bM-^@M-^\and that for$
two reasons. First, because IM-bM-^@M-^Ym on the same side of the door as you$
are; secondly, because theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre making such a noise inside, no one could$
possibly hear you.M-bM-^@M-^] And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary$
noise going on withinM-bM-^@M-^Ta constant howling and sneezing, and every now$
and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to$
pieces.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Please, then,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\how am I to get in?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There might be some sense in your knocking,M-bM-^@M-^] the Footman went on$
without attending to her, M-bM-^@M-^\if we had the door between us. For instance,$
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you$
know.M-bM-^@M-^] He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and$
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. M-bM-^@M-^\But perhaps he canM-bM-^@M-^Yt help it,M-bM-^@M-^]$
she said to herself; M-bM-^@M-^\his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his$
head. But at any rate he might answer questions.M-bM-^@M-^THow am I to get in?M-bM-^@M-^]$
she repeated, aloud.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I shall sit here,M-bM-^@M-^] the Footman remarked, M-bM-^@M-^\till tomorrowM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came$
skimming out, straight at the FootmanM-bM-^@M-^Ys head: it just grazed his nose,$
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tor next day, maybe,M-bM-^@M-^] the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly$
as if nothing had happened.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How am I to get in?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Alice again, in a louder tone.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_Are_ you to get in at all?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Footman. M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the first$
question, you know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys really$
dreadful,M-bM-^@M-^] she muttered to herself, M-bM-^@M-^\the way all the creatures argue.$
ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys enough to drive one crazy!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his$
remark, with variations. M-bM-^@M-^\I shall sit here,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\on and off, for$
days and days.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But what am _I_ to do?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Anything you like,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Footman, and began whistling.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no use in talking to him,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice desperately: M-bM-^@M-^\heM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
perfectly idiotic!M-bM-^@M-^] And she opened the door and went in.$
$
The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from$
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool$
in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,$
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys certainly too much pepper in that soup!M-bM-^@M-^] Alice said to$
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.$
$
There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed$
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling$
alternately without a momentM-bM-^@M-^Ys pause. The only things in the kitchen$
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting$
on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Please would you tell me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, a little timidly, for she was$
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, M-bM-^@M-^\why$
your cat grins like that?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys a Cheshire cat,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess, M-bM-^@M-^\and thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys why. Pig!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite$
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the$
baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
know that cats _could_ grin.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\They all can,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess; M-bM-^@M-^\and most of M-bM-^@M-^Yem do.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know of any that do,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice said very politely, feeling quite$
pleased to have got into a conversation.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know much,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess; M-bM-^@M-^\and thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys a fact.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would$
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she$
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the$
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at$
the Duchess and the babyM-bM-^@M-^Tthe fire-irons came first; then followed a$
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of$
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,$
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, _please_ mind what youM-bM-^@M-^Yre doing!M-bM-^@M-^] cried Alice, jumping up and down$
in an agony of terror. M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!M-bM-^@M-^] as an$
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it$
off.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If everybody minded their own business,M-bM-^@M-^] the Duchess said in a hoarse$
growl, M-bM-^@M-^\the world would go round a deal faster than it does.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Which would _not_ be an advantage,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, who felt very glad to$
get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. M-bM-^@M-^\Just$
think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the$
earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axisM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Talking of axes,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess, M-bM-^@M-^\chop off her head!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take$
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to$
be listening, so she went on again: M-bM-^@M-^\Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or$
is it twelve? IM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, donM-bM-^@M-^Yt bother _me_,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess; M-bM-^@M-^\I never could abide$
figures!M-bM-^@M-^] And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a$
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at$
the end of every line:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Speak roughly to your little boy,$
    And beat him when he sneezes:$
He only does it to annoy,$
    Because he knows it teases.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$
CHORUS.$
(In which the cook and the baby joined):$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Wow! wow! wow!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing$
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,$
that Alice could hardly hear the words:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I speak severely to my boy,$
    I beat him when he sneezes;$
For he can thoroughly enjoy$
    The pepper when he pleases!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$
CHORUS.$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Wow! wow! wow!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!M-bM-^@M-^] the Duchess said to Alice,$
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. M-bM-^@M-^\I must go and get ready to play$
croquet with the Queen,M-bM-^@M-^] and she hurried out of the room. The cook$
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.$
$
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped$
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,$
M-bM-^@M-^\just like a star-fish,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice. The poor little thing was$
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling$
itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for$
the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.$
$
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to$
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right$
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it$
out into the open air. M-bM-^@M-^\If I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt take this child away with me,M-bM-^@M-^]$
thought Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt it be$
murder to leave it behind?M-bM-^@M-^] She said the last words out loud, and the$
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt grunt,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys not at all a proper way of$
expressing yourself.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face$
to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had$
a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also$
its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did$
not like the look of the thing at all. M-bM-^@M-^\But perhaps it was only$
sobbing,M-bM-^@M-^] she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there$
were any tears.$
$
No, there were no tears. M-bM-^@M-^\If youM-bM-^@M-^Yre going to turn into a pig, my dear,M-bM-^@M-^]$
said Alice, seriously, M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll have nothing more to do with you. Mind$
now!M-bM-^@M-^] The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible$
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.$
$
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, M-bM-^@M-^\Now, what am I to do$
with this creature when I get it home?M-bM-^@M-^] when it grunted again, so$
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time$
there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than$
a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it$
further.$
$
So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it$
trot away quietly into the wood. M-bM-^@M-^\If it had grown up,M-bM-^@M-^] she said to$
herself, M-bM-^@M-^\it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes$
rather a handsome pig, I think.M-bM-^@M-^] And she began thinking over other$
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying$
to herself, M-bM-^@M-^\if one only knew the right way to change themM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] when she$
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of$
a tree a few yards off.$
$
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she$
thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she$
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Cheshire Puss,M-bM-^@M-^] she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know$
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little$
wider. M-bM-^@M-^\Come, itM-bM-^@M-^Ys pleased so far,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice, and she went on.$
M-bM-^@M-^\Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt much care whereM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then it doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt matter which way you go,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tso long as I get _somewhere_,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice added as an explanation.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, youM-bM-^@M-^Yre sure to do that,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat, M-bM-^@M-^\if you only walk long$
enough.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another$
question. M-bM-^@M-^\What sort of people live about here?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In _that_ direction,M-bM-^@M-^] the Cat said, waving its right paw round, M-bM-^@M-^\lives$
a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,M-bM-^@M-^] waving the other paw, M-bM-^@M-^\lives a$
March Hare. Visit either you like: theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre both mad.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want to go among mad people,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice remarked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, you canM-bM-^@M-^Yt help that,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat: M-bM-^@M-^\weM-bM-^@M-^Yre all mad here. IM-bM-^@M-^Ym mad.$
YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre mad.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How do you know IM-bM-^@M-^Ym mad?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You must be,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat, M-bM-^@M-^\or you wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt have come here.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt think that proved it at all; however, she went on M-bM-^@M-^\And how$
do you know that youM-bM-^@M-^Yre mad?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\To begin with,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat, M-bM-^@M-^\a dogM-bM-^@M-^Ys not mad. You grant that?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I suppose so,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, then,M-bM-^@M-^] the Cat went on, M-bM-^@M-^\you see, a dog growls when itM-bM-^@M-^Ys angry,$
and wags its tail when itM-bM-^@M-^Ys pleased. Now _I_ growl when IM-bM-^@M-^Ym pleased,$
and wag my tail when IM-bM-^@M-^Ym angry. Therefore IM-bM-^@M-^Ym mad.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_I_ call it purring, not growling,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Call it what you like,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat. M-bM-^@M-^\Do you play croquet with the$
Queen to-day?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I should like it very much,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\but I havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt been invited$
yet.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yll see me there,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat, and vanished.$
$
Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer$
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,$
it suddenly appeared again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\By-the-bye, what became of the baby?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yd nearly$
forgotten to ask.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It turned into a pig,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back$
in a natural way.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I thought it would,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat, and vanished again.$
$
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not$
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in$
which the March Hare was said to live. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve seen hatters before,M-bM-^@M-^] she$
said to herself; M-bM-^@M-^\the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and$
perhaps as this is May it wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt be raving madM-bM-^@M-^Tat least not so mad as it$
was in March.M-bM-^@M-^] As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat$
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Did you say pig, or fig?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I said pig,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\and I wish you wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt keep appearing$
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\All right,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,$
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which$
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well! IM-bM-^@M-^Yve often seen a cat without a grin,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\but a$
grin without a cat! ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of$
the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the$
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It$
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had$
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself$
to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather$
timidly, saying to herself M-bM-^@M-^\Suppose it should be raving mad after all!$
I almost wish IM-bM-^@M-^Yd gone to see the Hatter instead!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$
$
$
CHAPTER VII.$
A Mad Tea-Party$
$
$
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the$
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting$
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a$
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. M-bM-^@M-^\Very$
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\only, as itM-bM-^@M-^Ys asleep,$
I suppose it doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt mind.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at$
one corner of it: M-bM-^@M-^\No room! No room!M-bM-^@M-^] they cried out when they saw$
Alice coming. M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys _plenty_ of room!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice indignantly, and$
she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Have some wine,M-bM-^@M-^] the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.$
$
Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt see any wine,M-bM-^@M-^] she remarked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt any,M-bM-^@M-^] said the March Hare.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then it wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt very civil of you to offer it,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice angrily.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt very civil of you to sit down without being invited,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
the March Hare.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt know it was _your_ table,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\itM-bM-^@M-^Ys laid for a great$
many more than three.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Your hair wants cutting,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter. He had been looking at$
Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first$
speech.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You should learn not to make personal remarks,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice said with some$
severity; M-bM-^@M-^\itM-bM-^@M-^Ys very rude.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_$
was, M-bM-^@M-^\Why is a raven like a writing-desk?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Come, we shall have some fun now!M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym glad theyM-bM-^@M-^Yve$
begun asking riddles.M-bM-^@M-^TI believe I can guess that,M-bM-^@M-^] she added aloud.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?M-bM-^@M-^] said$
the March Hare.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Exactly so,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then you should say what you mean,M-bM-^@M-^] the March Hare went on.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I do,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice hastily replied; M-bM-^@M-^\at leastM-bM-^@M-^Tat least I mean what I$
sayM-bM-^@M-^TthatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the same thing, you know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not the same thing a bit!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter. M-bM-^@M-^\You might just as well$
say that M-bM-^@M-^XI see what I eatM-bM-^@M-^Y is the same thing as M-bM-^@M-^XI eat what I seeM-bM-^@M-^Y!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You might just as well say,M-bM-^@M-^] added the March Hare, M-bM-^@M-^\that M-bM-^@M-^XI like what$
I getM-bM-^@M-^Y is the same thing as M-bM-^@M-^XI get what I likeM-bM-^@M-^Y!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You might just as well say,M-bM-^@M-^] added the Dormouse, who seemed to be$
talking in his sleep, M-bM-^@M-^\that M-bM-^@M-^XI breathe when I sleepM-bM-^@M-^Y is the same thing$
as M-bM-^@M-^XI sleep when I breatheM-bM-^@M-^Y!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It _is_ the same thing with you,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter, and here the$
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while$
Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and$
writing-desks, which wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt much.$
$
The Hatter was the first to break the silence. M-bM-^@M-^\What day of the month$
is it?M-bM-^@M-^] he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his$
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,$
and holding it to his ear.$
$
Alice considered a little, and then said M-bM-^@M-^\The fourth.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Two days wrong!M-bM-^@M-^] sighed the Hatter. M-bM-^@M-^\I told you butter wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt suit$
the works!M-bM-^@M-^] he added looking angrily at the March Hare.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It was the _best_ butter,M-bM-^@M-^] the March Hare meekly replied.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,M-bM-^@M-^] the Hatter grumbled:$
M-bM-^@M-^\you shouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt have put it in with the bread-knife.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped$
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of$
nothing better to say than his first remark, M-bM-^@M-^\It was the _best_ butter,$
you know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. M-bM-^@M-^\What a$
funny watch!M-bM-^@M-^] she remarked. M-bM-^@M-^\It tells the day of the month, and doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
tell what oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock it is!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why should it?M-bM-^@M-^] muttered the Hatter. M-bM-^@M-^\Does _your_ watch tell you what$
year it is?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course not,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice replied very readily: M-bM-^@M-^\but thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys because it$
stays the same year for such a long time together.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Which is just the case with _mine_,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter.$
$
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The HatterM-bM-^@M-^Ys remark seemed to have no$
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt quite$
understand you,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, as politely as she could.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The Dormouse is asleep again,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter, and he poured a little$
hot tea upon its nose.$
$
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its$
eyes, M-bM-^@M-^\Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Have you guessed the riddle yet?M-bM-^@M-^] the Hatter said, turning to Alice$
again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, I give it up,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice replied: M-bM-^@M-^\whatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the answer?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt the slightest idea,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Nor I,M-bM-^@M-^] said the March Hare.$
$
Alice sighed wearily. M-bM-^@M-^\I think you might do something better with the$
time,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, M-bM-^@M-^\than waste it in asking riddles that have no$
answers.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If you knew Time as well as I do,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter, M-bM-^@M-^\you wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt talk$
about wasting _it_. ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys _him_.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know what you mean,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt!M-bM-^@M-^] the Hatter said, tossing his head$
contemptuously. M-bM-^@M-^\I dare say you never even spoke to Time!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Perhaps not,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice cautiously replied: M-bM-^@M-^\but I know I have to beat$
time when I learn music.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ah! that accounts for it,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter. M-bM-^@M-^\He wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt stand beating.$
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, heM-bM-^@M-^Yd do almost anything$
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock in$
the morning, just time to begin lessons: youM-bM-^@M-^Yd only have to whisper a$
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,$
time for dinner!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
(M-bM-^@M-^\I only wish it was,M-bM-^@M-^] the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That would be grand, certainly,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice thoughtfully: M-bM-^@M-^\but thenM-bM-^@M-^TI$
shouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt be hungry for it, you know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not at first, perhaps,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter: M-bM-^@M-^\but you could keep it to$
half-past one as long as you liked.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Is that the way _you_ manage?M-bM-^@M-^] Alice asked.$
$
The Hatter shook his head mournfully. M-bM-^@M-^\Not I!M-bM-^@M-^] he replied. M-bM-^@M-^\We$
quarrelled last MarchM-bM-^@M-^Tjust before _he_ went mad, you knowM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] (pointing$
with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tit was at the great concert$
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing$
$
M-bM-^@M-^XTwinkle, twinkle, little bat!$
How I wonder what youM-bM-^@M-^Yre at!M-bM-^@M-^Y$
$
$
You know the song, perhaps?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve heard something like it,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It goes on, you know,M-bM-^@M-^] the Hatter continued, M-bM-^@M-^\in this way:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^XUp above the world you fly,$
Like a tea-tray in the sky.$
                    Twinkle, twinkleM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep$
M-bM-^@M-^\_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_M-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] and went on so long that they$
had to pinch it to make it stop.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, IM-bM-^@M-^Yd hardly finished the first verse,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter, M-bM-^@M-^\when the$
Queen jumped up and bawled out, M-bM-^@M-^XHeM-bM-^@M-^Ys murdering the time! Off with his$
head!M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How dreadfully savage!M-bM-^@M-^] exclaimed Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And ever since that,M-bM-^@M-^] the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, M-bM-^@M-^\he wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
do a thing I ask! ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys always six oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock now.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
A bright idea came into AliceM-bM-^@M-^Ys head. M-bM-^@M-^\Is that the reason so many$
tea-things are put out here?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys it,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter with a sigh: M-bM-^@M-^\itM-bM-^@M-^Ys always tea-time,$
and weM-bM-^@M-^Yve no time to wash the things between whiles.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then you keep moving round, I suppose?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Exactly so,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter: M-bM-^@M-^\as the things get used up.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But what happens when you come to the beginning again?M-bM-^@M-^] Alice ventured$
to ask.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Suppose we change the subject,M-bM-^@M-^] the March Hare interrupted, yawning.$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym afraid I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know one,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, rather alarmed at the$
proposal.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then the Dormouse shall!M-bM-^@M-^] they both cried. M-bM-^@M-^\Wake up, Dormouse!M-bM-^@M-^] And$
they pinched it on both sides at once.$
$
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. M-bM-^@M-^\I wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt asleep,M-bM-^@M-^] he said in a$
hoarse, feeble voice: M-bM-^@M-^\I heard every word you fellows were saying.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Tell us a story!M-bM-^@M-^] said the March Hare.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, please do!M-bM-^@M-^] pleaded Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And be quick about it,M-bM-^@M-^] added the Hatter, M-bM-^@M-^\or youM-bM-^@M-^Yll be asleep again$
before itM-bM-^@M-^Ys done.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Once upon a time there were three little sisters,M-bM-^@M-^] the Dormouse began$
in a great hurry; M-bM-^@M-^\and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and$
they lived at the bottom of a wellM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What did they live on?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, who always took a great interest$
in questions of eating and drinking.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\They lived on treacle,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or$
two.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\They couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt have done that, you know,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice gently remarked;$
M-bM-^@M-^\theyM-bM-^@M-^Yd have been ill.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\So they were,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dormouse; M-bM-^@M-^\_very_ ill.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of$
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: M-bM-^@M-^\But$
why did they live at the bottom of a well?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Take some more tea,M-bM-^@M-^] the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve had nothing yet,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice replied in an offended tone, M-bM-^@M-^\so I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
take more.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You mean you canM-bM-^@M-^Yt take _less_,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter: M-bM-^@M-^\itM-bM-^@M-^Ys very easy to$
take _more_ than nothing.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Nobody asked _your_ opinion,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\WhoM-bM-^@M-^Ys making personal remarks now?M-bM-^@M-^] the Hatter asked triumphantly.$
$
Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to$
some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and$
repeated her question. M-bM-^@M-^\Why did they live at the bottom of a well?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then$
said, M-bM-^@M-^\It was a treacle-well.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no such thing!M-bM-^@M-^] Alice was beginning very angrily, but the$
Hatter and the March Hare went M-bM-^@M-^\Sh! sh!M-bM-^@M-^] and the Dormouse sulkily$
remarked, M-bM-^@M-^\If you canM-bM-^@M-^Yt be civil, youM-bM-^@M-^Yd better finish the story for$
yourself.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, please go on!M-bM-^@M-^] Alice said very humbly; M-bM-^@M-^\I wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt interrupt again. I$
dare say there may be _one_.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\One, indeed!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to$
go on. M-bM-^@M-^\And so these three little sistersM-bM-^@M-^Tthey were learning to draw,$
you knowM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What did they draw?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Treacle,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I want a clean cup,M-bM-^@M-^] interrupted the Hatter: M-bM-^@M-^\letM-bM-^@M-^Ys all move one place$
on.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare$
moved into the DormouseM-bM-^@M-^Ys place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the$
place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any$
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than$
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.$
$
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very$
cautiously: M-bM-^@M-^\But I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt understand. Where did they draw the treacle$
from?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You can draw water out of a water-well,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter; M-bM-^@M-^\so I should$
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-wellM-bM-^@M-^Teh, stupid?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But they were _in_ the well,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing$
to notice this last remark.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course they were,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dormouse; M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Twell in.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for$
some time without interrupting it.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\They were learning to draw,M-bM-^@M-^] the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing$
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; M-bM-^@M-^\and they drew all manner of$
thingsM-bM-^@M-^Teverything that begins with an MM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why with an M?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why not?M-bM-^@M-^] said the March Hare.$
$
Alice was silent.$
$
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a$
doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a$
little shriek, and went on: M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tthat begins with an M, such as$
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchnessM-bM-^@M-^Tyou know you say$
things are M-bM-^@M-^\much of a muchnessM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^Tdid you ever see such a thing as a$
drawing of a muchness?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Really, now you ask me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, very much confused, M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
thinkM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then you shouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt talk,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter.$
$
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in$
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and$
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she$
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:$
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into$
the teapot.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\At any rate IM-bM-^@M-^Yll never go _there_ again!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice as she picked her$
way through the wood. M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in$
all my life!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door$
leading right into it. M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys very curious!M-bM-^@M-^] she thought. M-bM-^@M-^\But$
everythingM-bM-^@M-^Ys curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.M-bM-^@M-^] And$
in she went.$
$
Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little$
glass table. M-bM-^@M-^\Now, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll manage better this time,M-bM-^@M-^] she said to herself,$
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that$
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom$
(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot$
high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_M-bM-^@M-^Tshe found$
herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds$
and the cool fountains.$

$
CHAPTER VIII.$
The QueenM-bM-^@M-^Ys Croquet-Ground$
$
$
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses$
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily$
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she$
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard$
one of them say, M-bM-^@M-^\Look out now, Five! DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt go splashing paint over me$
like that!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt help it,M-bM-^@M-^] said Five, in a sulky tone; M-bM-^@M-^\Seven jogged my$
elbow.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
On which Seven looked up and said, M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys right, Five! Always lay the$
blame on others!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_YouM-bM-^@M-^Yd_ better not talk!M-bM-^@M-^] said Five. M-bM-^@M-^\I heard the Queen say only$
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What for?M-bM-^@M-^] said the one who had spoken first.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys none of _your_ business, Two!M-bM-^@M-^] said Seven.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, it _is_ his business!M-bM-^@M-^] said Five, M-bM-^@M-^\and IM-bM-^@M-^Yll tell himM-bM-^@M-^Tit was for$
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun M-bM-^@M-^\Well, of all the unjust$
thingsM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching$
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,$
and all of them bowed low.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Would you tell me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, a little timidly, M-bM-^@M-^\why you are$
painting those roses?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low$
voice, M-bM-^@M-^\Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a$
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen$
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So$
you see, Miss, weM-bM-^@M-^Yre doing our best, afore she comes, toM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] At this$
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called$
out M-bM-^@M-^\The Queen! The Queen!M-bM-^@M-^] and the three gardeners instantly threw$
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,$
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.$
$
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the$
three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the$
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with$
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came$
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came$
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all$
ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,$
and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a$
hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went$
by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying$
the KingM-bM-^@M-^Ys crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this$
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.$
$
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face$
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard$
of such a rule at processions; M-bM-^@M-^\and besides, what would be the use of a$
procession,M-bM-^@M-^] thought she, M-bM-^@M-^\if people had all to lie down upon their$
faces, so that they couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt see it?M-bM-^@M-^] So she stood still where she was,$
and waited.$
$
When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked$
at her, and the Queen said severely M-bM-^@M-^\Who is this?M-bM-^@M-^] She said it to the$
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Idiot!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to$
Alice, she went on, M-bM-^@M-^\WhatM-bM-^@M-^Ys your name, child?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice very politely;$
but she added, to herself, M-bM-^@M-^\Why, theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre only a pack of cards, after$
all. I neednM-bM-^@M-^Yt be afraid of them!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And who are _these?_M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners$
who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on$
their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of$
the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,$
or courtiers, or three of her own children.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How should _I_ know?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, surprised at her own courage. M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
no business of _mine_.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a$
moment like a wild beast, screamed M-bM-^@M-^\Off with her head! OffM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Nonsense!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was$
silent.$
$
The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said M-bM-^@M-^\Consider, my$
dear: she is only a child!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave M-bM-^@M-^\Turn$
them over!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Get up!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three$
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,$
the royal children, and everybody else.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Leave off that!M-bM-^@M-^] screamed the Queen. M-bM-^@M-^\You make me giddy.M-bM-^@M-^] And then,$
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, M-bM-^@M-^\What _have_ you been doing$
here?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\May it please your Majesty,M-bM-^@M-^] said Two, in a very humble tone, going$
down on one knee as he spoke, M-bM-^@M-^\we were tryingM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_I_ see!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.$
M-bM-^@M-^\Off with their heads!M-bM-^@M-^] and the procession moved on, three of the$
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran$
to Alice for protection.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You shanM-bM-^@M-^Yt be beheaded!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, and she put them into a large$
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a$
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the$
others.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Are their heads off?M-bM-^@M-^] shouted the Queen.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!M-bM-^@M-^] the soldiers shouted$
in reply.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys right!M-bM-^@M-^] shouted the Queen. M-bM-^@M-^\Can you play croquet?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was$
evidently meant for her.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes!M-bM-^@M-^] shouted Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Come on, then!M-bM-^@M-^] roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,$
wondering very much what would happen next.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^YsM-bM-^@M-^TitM-bM-^@M-^Ys a very fine day!M-bM-^@M-^] said a timid voice at her side. She was$
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Very,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice: M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^TwhereM-bM-^@M-^Ys the Duchess?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Hush! Hush!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked$
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon$
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered M-bM-^@M-^\SheM-bM-^@M-^Ys under$
sentence of execution.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What for?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Did you say M-bM-^@M-^XWhat a pity!M-bM-^@M-^Y?M-bM-^@M-^] the Rabbit asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice: M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt think itM-bM-^@M-^Ys at all a pity. I said$
M-bM-^@M-^XWhat for?M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\She boxed the QueenM-bM-^@M-^Ys earsM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little$
scream of laughter. M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, hush!M-bM-^@M-^] the Rabbit whispered in a frightened$
tone. M-bM-^@M-^\The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the$
Queen saidM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Get to your places!M-bM-^@M-^] shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and$
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each$
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game$
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground$
in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live$
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double$
themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.$
$
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:$
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,$
under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she$
had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the$
hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look$
up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help$
bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was$
going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog$
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all$
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she$
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were$
always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice$
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.$
$
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling$
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time$
the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and$
shouting M-bM-^@M-^\Off with his head!M-bM-^@M-^] or M-bM-^@M-^\Off with her head!M-bM-^@M-^] about once in a$
minute.$
$
Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any$
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,$
M-bM-^@M-^\and then,M-bM-^@M-^] thought she, M-bM-^@M-^\what would become of me? TheyM-bM-^@M-^Yre dreadfully$
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys any$
one left alive!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she$
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious$
appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after$
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said$
to herself M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk$
to.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How are you getting on?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth$
enough for it to speak with.$
$
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys no use$
speaking to it,M-bM-^@M-^] she thought, M-bM-^@M-^\till its ears have come, or at least one$
of them.M-bM-^@M-^] In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put$
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad$
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there$
was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt think they play at all fairly,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice began, in rather a$
complaining tone, M-bM-^@M-^\and they all quarrel so dreadfully one canM-bM-^@M-^Yt hear$
oneself speakM-bM-^@M-^Tand they donM-bM-^@M-^Yt seem to have any rules in particular; at$
least, if there are, nobody attends to themM-bM-^@M-^Tand youM-bM-^@M-^Yve no idea how$
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys the$
arch IM-bM-^@M-^Yve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the$
groundM-bM-^@M-^Tand I should have croqueted the QueenM-bM-^@M-^Ys hedgehog just now, only$
it ran away when it saw mine coming!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How do you like the Queen?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Cat in a low voice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not at all,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice: M-bM-^@M-^\sheM-bM-^@M-^Ys so extremelyM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] Just then she noticed$
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tlikely to win, that itM-bM-^@M-^Ys hardly worth while finishing the game.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Queen smiled and passed on.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Who _are_ you talking to?M-bM-^@M-^] said the King, going up to Alice, and$
looking at the CatM-bM-^@M-^Ys head with great curiosity.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys a friend of mineM-bM-^@M-^Ta Cheshire Cat,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice: M-bM-^@M-^\allow me to$
introduce it.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt like the look of it at all,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King: M-bM-^@M-^\however, it may$
kiss my hand if it likes.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yd rather not,M-bM-^@M-^] the Cat remarked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt be impertinent,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King, M-bM-^@M-^\and donM-bM-^@M-^Yt look at me like$
that!M-bM-^@M-^] He got behind Alice as he spoke.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A cat may look at a king,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve read that in some book,$
but I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt remember where.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, it must be removed,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King very decidedly, and he called$
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, M-bM-^@M-^\My dear! I wish you would$
have this cat removed!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or$
small. M-bM-^@M-^\Off with his head!M-bM-^@M-^] she said, without even looking round.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll fetch the executioner myself,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King eagerly, and he$
hurried off.$
$
Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going$
on, as she heard the QueenM-bM-^@M-^Ys voice in the distance, screaming with$
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be$
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look$
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew$
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.$
$
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed$
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the$
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to$
the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a$
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.$
$
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight$
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: M-bM-^@M-^\but it doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
matter much,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\as all the arches are gone from this side$
of the ground.M-bM-^@M-^] So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not$
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her$
friend.$
$
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite$
a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between$
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,$
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.$
$
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle$
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they$
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly$
what they said.$
$
The executionerM-bM-^@M-^Ys argument was, that you couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt cut off a head unless$
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a$
thing before, and he wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt going to begin at _his_ time of life.$
$
The KingM-bM-^@M-^Ys argument was, that anything that had a head could be$
beheaded, and that you werenM-bM-^@M-^Yt to talk nonsense.$
$
The QueenM-bM-^@M-^Ys argument was, that if something wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt done about it in$
less than no time sheM-bM-^@M-^Yd have everybody executed, all round. (It was$
this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and$
anxious.)$
$
Alice could think of nothing else to say but M-bM-^@M-^\It belongs to the$
Duchess: youM-bM-^@M-^Yd better ask _her_ about it.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\SheM-bM-^@M-^Ys in prison,M-bM-^@M-^] the Queen said to the executioner: M-bM-^@M-^\fetch her here.M-bM-^@M-^]$
And the executioner went off like an arrow.$
$
The CatM-bM-^@M-^Ys head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the$
time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so$
the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,$
while the rest of the party went back to the game.$
$
$

CHAPTER IX.$
The Mock TurtleM-bM-^@M-^Ys Story$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You canM-bM-^@M-^Yt think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!M-bM-^@M-^]$
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into AliceM-bM-^@M-^Ys,$
and they walked off together.$
$
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought$
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so$
savage when they met in the kitchen.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\When _IM-bM-^@M-^Ym_ a Duchess,M-bM-^@M-^] she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful$
tone though), M-bM-^@M-^\I wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup$
does very well withoutM-bM-^@M-^TMaybe itM-bM-^@M-^Ys always pepper that makes people$
hot-tempered,M-bM-^@M-^] she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new$
kind of rule, M-bM-^@M-^\and vinegar that makes them sourM-bM-^@M-^Tand camomile that makes$
them bitterM-bM-^@M-^TandM-bM-^@M-^Tand barley-sugar and such things that make children$
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt be$
so stingy about it, you knowM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little$
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre thinking$
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in$
a bit.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Perhaps it hasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt one,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice ventured to remark.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Tut, tut, child!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess. M-bM-^@M-^\EverythingM-bM-^@M-^Ys got a moral, if only$
you can find it.M-bM-^@M-^] And she squeezed herself up closer to AliceM-bM-^@M-^Ys side as$
she spoke.$
$
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the$
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the$
right height to rest her chin upon AliceM-bM-^@M-^Ys shoulder, and it was an$
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she$
bore it as well as she could.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The gameM-bM-^@M-^Ys going on rather better now,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, by way of keeping up$
the conversation a little.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^YTis so,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess: M-bM-^@M-^\and the moral of that isM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^XOh, M-bM-^@M-^Ytis love,$
M-bM-^@M-^Ytis love, that makes the world go round!M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Somebody said,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice whispered, M-bM-^@M-^\that itM-bM-^@M-^Ys done by everybody minding$
their own business!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ah, well! It means much the same thing,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess, digging her$
sharp little chin into AliceM-bM-^@M-^Ys shoulder as she added, M-bM-^@M-^\and the moral of$
_that_ isM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^XTake care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of$
themselves.M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How fond she is of finding morals in things!M-bM-^@M-^] Alice thought to$
herself.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I dare say youM-bM-^@M-^Yre wondering why I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt put my arm round your waist,M-bM-^@M-^]$
the Duchess said after a pause: M-bM-^@M-^\the reason is, that IM-bM-^@M-^Ym doubtful about$
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He might bite,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious$
to have the experiment tried.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Very true,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess: M-bM-^@M-^\flamingoes and mustard both bite. And$
the moral of that isM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^XBirds of a feather flock together.M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Only mustard isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt a bird,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice remarked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Right, as usual,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess: M-bM-^@M-^\what a clear way you have of$
putting things!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys a mineral, I _think_,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course it is,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to$
everything that Alice said; M-bM-^@M-^\thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys a large mustard-mine near here.$
And the moral of that isM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^XThe more there is of mine, the less there is$
of yours.M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, I know!M-bM-^@M-^] exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last$
remark, M-bM-^@M-^\itM-bM-^@M-^Ys a vegetable. It doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt look like one, but it is.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I quite agree with you,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess; M-bM-^@M-^\and the moral of that$
isM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^XBe what you would seem to beM-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^Tor if youM-bM-^@M-^Yd like it put more$

$
M-bM-^@M-^\I think I should understand that better,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice said very politely,$
M-bM-^@M-^\if I had it written down: but I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt quite follow it as you say it.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys nothing to what I could say if I chose,M-bM-^@M-^] the Duchess replied,$
in a pleased tone.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Pray donM-bM-^@M-^Yt trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, donM-bM-^@M-^Yt talk about trouble!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess. M-bM-^@M-^\I make you a present$
of everything IM-bM-^@M-^Yve said as yet.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A cheap sort of present!M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym glad they donM-bM-^@M-^Yt give$
birthday presents like that!M-bM-^@M-^] But she did not venture to say it out$
loud.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Thinking again?M-bM-^@M-^] the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp$
little chin.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve a right to think,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to$
feel a little worried.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Just about as much right,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Duchess, M-bM-^@M-^\as pigs have to fly; and$
the mM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
But here, to AliceM-bM-^@M-^Ys great surprise, the DuchessM-bM-^@M-^Ys voice died away,$
even in the middle of her favourite word M-bM-^@M-^Xmoral,M-bM-^@M-^Y and the arm that was$
linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the$
Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a$
thunderstorm.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A fine day, your Majesty!M-bM-^@M-^] the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Now, I give you fair warning,M-bM-^@M-^] shouted the Queen, stamping on the$
ground as she spoke; M-bM-^@M-^\either you or your head must be off, and that in$
about half no time! Take your choice!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\LetM-bM-^@M-^Ys go on with the game,M-bM-^@M-^] the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too$
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the$
croquet-ground.$
$
The other guests had taken advantage of the QueenM-bM-^@M-^Ys absence, and were$
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried$
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a momentM-bM-^@M-^Ys delay$
would cost them their lives.$
$
All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling$
with the other players, and shouting M-bM-^@M-^\Off with his head!M-bM-^@M-^] or M-bM-^@M-^\Off with$
her head!M-bM-^@M-^] Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the$
soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so$
that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and$
all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody$
and under sentence of execution.$
$
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\Have$
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt even know what a Mock Turtle is.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I never saw one, or heard of one,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Come on, then,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen, M-bM-^@M-^\and he shall tell you his history,M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,$
to the company generally, M-bM-^@M-^\You are all pardoned.M-bM-^@M-^] M-bM-^@M-^\Come, _thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys_ a$
good thing!M-bM-^@M-^] she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the$
number of executions the Queen had ordered.$
$
They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If$
you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) M-bM-^@M-^\Up, lazy$
thing!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen, M-bM-^@M-^\and take this young lady to see the Mock$
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some$
executions I have ordered;M-bM-^@M-^] and she walked off, leaving Alice alone$
with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,$
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it$
as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.$
$
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till$
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. M-bM-^@M-^\What fun!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon,$
half to itself, half to Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What _is_ the fun?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why, _she_,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon. M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys all her fancy, that: they never$
executes nobody, you know. Come on!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Everybody says M-bM-^@M-^Xcome on!M-bM-^@M-^Y here,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice, as she went slowly$
after it: M-bM-^@M-^\I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,$
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came$
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She$
pitied him deeply. M-bM-^@M-^\What is his sorrow?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked the Gryphon, and the$
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys all$
his fancy, that: he hasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt got no sorrow, you know. Come on!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes$
full of tears, but said nothing.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\This here young lady,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon, M-bM-^@M-^\she wants for to know your$
history, she do.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll tell it her,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: M-bM-^@M-^\sit$
down, both of you, and donM-bM-^@M-^Yt speak a word till IM-bM-^@M-^Yve finished.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to$
herself, M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt begin.M-bM-^@M-^]$
But she waited patiently.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Once,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, M-bM-^@M-^\I was a real$
Turtle.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an$
occasional exclamation of M-bM-^@M-^\Hjckrrh!M-bM-^@M-^] from the Gryphon, and the constant$
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and$
saying, M-bM-^@M-^\Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,M-bM-^@M-^] but she could not$
help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said$
nothing.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\When we were little,M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,$
though still sobbing a little now and then, M-bM-^@M-^\we went to school in the$
sea. The master was an old TurtleM-bM-^@M-^Twe used to call him TortoiseM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt one?M-bM-^@M-^] Alice asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We called him Tortoise because he taught us,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle$
angrily: M-bM-^@M-^\really you are very dull!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple$
question,M-bM-^@M-^] added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked$
at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the$
Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, M-bM-^@M-^\Drive on, old fellow! DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt be all$
day about it!M-bM-^@M-^] and he went on in these words:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you maynM-bM-^@M-^Yt believe itM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I never said I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt!M-bM-^@M-^] interrupted Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You did,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Hold your tongue!M-bM-^@M-^] added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.$
The Mock Turtle went on.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We had the best of educationsM-bM-^@M-^Tin fact, we went to school every dayM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_IM-bM-^@M-^Yve_ been to a day-school, too,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\you neednM-bM-^@M-^Yt be so$
proud as all that.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\With extras?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\we learned French and music.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And washing?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Certainly not!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice indignantly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ah! then yours wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt a really good school,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle in a$
tone of great relief. M-bM-^@M-^\Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,$
M-bM-^@M-^XFrench, music, _and washing_M-bM-^@M-^Textra.M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt have wanted it much,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\living at the bottom$
of the sea.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt afford to learn it.M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. M-bM-^@M-^\I$
only took the regular course.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What was that?M-bM-^@M-^] inquired Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle$
replied; M-bM-^@M-^\and then the different branches of ArithmeticM-bM-^@M-^TAmbition,$
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I never heard of M-bM-^@M-^XUglification,M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^] Alice ventured to say. M-bM-^@M-^\What is it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. M-bM-^@M-^\What! Never heard of$
uglifying!M-bM-^@M-^] it exclaimed. M-bM-^@M-^\You know what to beautify is, I suppose?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice doubtfully: M-bM-^@M-^\it meansM-bM-^@M-^TtoM-bM-^@M-^TmakeM-bM-^@M-^TanythingM-bM-^@M-^Tprettier.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, then,M-bM-^@M-^] the Gryphon went on, M-bM-^@M-^\if you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know what to uglify$
is, you _are_ a simpleton.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so$
she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said M-bM-^@M-^\What else had you to learn?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, there was Mystery,M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the$
subjects on his flappers, M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^TMystery, ancient and modern, with$
Seaography: then DrawlingM-bM-^@M-^Tthe Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,$
that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and$
Fainting in Coils.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What was _that_ like?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt show it you myself,M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle said: M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym too$
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\HadnM-bM-^@M-^Yt time,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon: M-bM-^@M-^\I went to the Classics master,$
though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I never went to him,M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: M-bM-^@M-^\he taught$
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\So he did, so he did,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both$
creatures hid their faces in their paws.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And how many hours a day did you do lessons?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, in a hurry$
to change the subject.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ten hours the first day,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle: M-bM-^@M-^\nine the next, and so$
on.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What a curious plan!M-bM-^@M-^] exclaimed Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the reason theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre called lessons,M-bM-^@M-^] the Gryphon remarked:$
M-bM-^@M-^\because they lessen from day to day.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little$
before she made her next remark. M-bM-^@M-^\Then the eleventh day must have been$
a holiday?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course it was,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And how did you manage on the twelfth?M-bM-^@M-^] Alice went on eagerly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys enough about lessons,M-bM-^@M-^] the Gryphon interrupted in a very$
decided tone: M-bM-^@M-^\tell her something about the games now.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$

$
CHAPTER X.$
The Lobster Quadrille$
$
$
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across$
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or$
two sobs choked his voice. M-bM-^@M-^\Same as if he had a bone in his throat,M-bM-^@M-^]$
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in$
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears$
running down his cheeks, he went on again:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You may not have lived much under the seaM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] (M-bM-^@M-^\I havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
Alice)M-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobsterM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
(Alice began to say M-bM-^@M-^\I once tastedM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] but checked herself hastily, and$
said M-bM-^@M-^\No, neverM-bM-^@M-^]) M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tso you can have no idea what a delightful thing a$
Lobster Quadrille is!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, indeed,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\What sort of a dance is it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon, M-bM-^@M-^\you first form into a line along the$
sea-shoreM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Two lines!M-bM-^@M-^] cried the Mock Turtle. M-bM-^@M-^\Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;$
then, when youM-bM-^@M-^Yve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the wayM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_That_ generally takes some time,M-bM-^@M-^] interrupted the Gryphon.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tyou advance twiceM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Each with a lobster as a partner!M-bM-^@M-^] cried the Gryphon.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course,M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle said: M-bM-^@M-^\advance twice, set to partnersM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tchange lobsters, and retire in same order,M-bM-^@M-^] continued the Gryphon.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then, you know,M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle went on, M-bM-^@M-^\you throw theM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The lobsters!M-bM-^@M-^] shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tas far out to sea as you canM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Swim after them!M-bM-^@M-^] screamed the Gryphon.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Turn a somersault in the sea!M-bM-^@M-^] cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly$
about.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Change lobsters again!M-bM-^@M-^] yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Back to land again, and thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys all the first figure,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock$
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had$
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very$
sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It must be a very pretty dance,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice timidly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Would you like to see a little of it?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Very much indeed,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Come, letM-bM-^@M-^Ys try the first figure!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle to the$
Gryphon. M-bM-^@M-^\We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, _you_ sing,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve forgotten the words.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and$
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their$
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly$
and sadly:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Will you walk a little faster?M-bM-^@M-^] said a whiting to a snail.$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys a porpoise close behind us, and heM-bM-^@M-^Ys treading on my tail.$
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!$
They are waiting on the shingleM-bM-^@M-^Twill you come and join the dance?$
Will you, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you, will you, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you, will you join the dance?$
Will you, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you, will you, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you join the dance?$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You can really have no notion how delightful it will be$
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!M-bM-^@M-^]$
But the snail replied M-bM-^@M-^\Too far, too far!M-bM-^@M-^] and gave a look askanceM-bM-^@M-^T$
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.$
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.$
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What matters it how far we go?M-bM-^@M-^] his scaly friend replied.$
M-bM-^@M-^\There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.$
The further off from England the nearer is to FranceM-bM-^@M-^T$
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.$
Will you, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you, will you, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you, will you join the dance?$
Will you, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you, will you, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you join the dance?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Thank you, itM-bM-^@M-^Ys a very interesting dance to watch,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice,$
feeling very glad that it was over at last: M-bM-^@M-^\and I do so like that$
curious song about the whiting!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, as to the whiting,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle, M-bM-^@M-^\theyM-bM-^@M-^TyouM-bM-^@M-^Yve seen them,$
of course?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve often seen them at dinnM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] she checked herself$
hastily.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know where Dinn may be,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle, M-bM-^@M-^\but if youM-bM-^@M-^Yve$
seen them so often, of course you know what theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre like.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I believe so,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice replied thoughtfully. M-bM-^@M-^\They have their tails in$
their mouthsM-bM-^@M-^Tand theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre all over crumbs.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre wrong about the crumbs,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle: M-bM-^@M-^\crumbs would$
all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;$
and the reason isM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his$
eyes.M-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\Tell her about the reason and all that,M-bM-^@M-^] he said to the Gryphon.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The reason is,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon, M-bM-^@M-^\that they _would_ go with the$
lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to$
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they$
couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt get them out again. ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys all.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Thank you,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\itM-bM-^@M-^Ys very interesting. I never knew so much$
about a whiting before.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I can tell you more than that, if you like,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon. M-bM-^@M-^\Do you$
know why itM-bM-^@M-^Ys called a whiting?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I never thought about it,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\Why?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_It does the boots and shoes_,M-bM-^@M-^] the Gryphon replied very solemnly.$
$
Alice was thoroughly puzzled. M-bM-^@M-^\Does the boots and shoes!M-bM-^@M-^] she repeated$
in a wondering tone.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon. M-bM-^@M-^\I mean, what$
makes them so shiny?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her$
answer. M-bM-^@M-^\TheyM-bM-^@M-^Yre done with blacking, I believe.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Boots and shoes under the sea,M-bM-^@M-^] the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,$
M-bM-^@M-^\are done with a whiting. Now you know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And what are they made of?M-bM-^@M-^] Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Soles and eels, of course,M-bM-^@M-^] the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:$
M-bM-^@M-^\any shrimp could have told you that.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If IM-bM-^@M-^Yd been the whiting,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, whose thoughts were still$
running on the song, M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yd have said to the porpoise, M-bM-^@M-^XKeep back,$
please: we donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want _you_ with us!M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\They were obliged to have him with them,M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle said: M-bM-^@M-^\no$
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\WouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt it really?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice in a tone of great surprise.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course not,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle: M-bM-^@M-^\why, if a fish came to _me_,$
and told me he was going a journey, I should say M-bM-^@M-^XWith what porpoise?M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you mean M-bM-^@M-^XpurposeM-bM-^@M-^Y?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I mean what I say,M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And$
the Gryphon added M-bM-^@M-^\Come, letM-bM-^@M-^Ys hear some of _your_ adventures.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I could tell you my adventuresM-bM-^@M-^Tbeginning from this morning,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
Alice a little timidly: M-bM-^@M-^\but itM-bM-^@M-^Ys no use going back to yesterday,$
because I was a different person then.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Explain all that,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, no! The adventures first,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:$
M-bM-^@M-^\explanations take such a dreadful time.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first$
saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,$
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened$
their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she$
went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part$
about her repeating M-bM-^@M-^\_You are old, Father William_,M-bM-^@M-^] to the$
Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock$
Turtle drew a long breath, and said M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys very curious.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys all about as curious as it can be,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It all came different!M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. M-bM-^@M-^\I$
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to$
begin.M-bM-^@M-^] He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of$
authority over Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Stand up and repeat M-bM-^@M-^XM-bM-^@M-^Y_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^] said the$
Gryphon.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!M-bM-^@M-^]$
thought Alice; M-bM-^@M-^\I might as well be at school at once.M-bM-^@M-^] However, she got$
up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster$
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came$
very queer indeed:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^YTis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,$
M-bM-^@M-^\You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.M-bM-^@M-^]$
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose$
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
[later editions continued as follows$
When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,$
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,$
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,$
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
the Gryphon.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, I never heard it before,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle; M-bM-^@M-^\but it sounds$
uncommon nonsense.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,$
wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I should like to have it explained,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Mock Turtle.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\She canM-bM-^@M-^Yt explain it,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon hastily. M-bM-^@M-^\Go on with the next$
verse.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But about his toes?M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle persisted. M-bM-^@M-^\How _could_ he turn$
them out with his nose, you know?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys the first position in dancing.M-bM-^@M-^] Alice said; but was dreadfully$
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Go on with the next verse,M-bM-^@M-^] the Gryphon repeated impatiently: M-bM-^@M-^\it$
begins M-bM-^@M-^X_I passed by his garden_.M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come$
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,$
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pieM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
[later editions continued as follows$
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,$
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.$
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,$
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:$
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,$
And concluded the banquetM-bM-^@M-^T]$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,M-bM-^@M-^] the Mock Turtle$
interrupted, M-bM-^@M-^\if you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt explain it as you go on? ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys by far the$
most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, I think youM-bM-^@M-^Yd better leave off,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Gryphon: and Alice was$
only too glad to do so.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?M-bM-^@M-^] the Gryphon$
went on. M-bM-^@M-^\Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,M-bM-^@M-^] Alice$
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,$
M-bM-^@M-^\Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her M-bM-^@M-^X_Turtle Soup_,M-bM-^@M-^Y will you, old$
fellow?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked$
with sobs, to sing this:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,$
Waiting in a hot tureen!$
Who for such dainties would not stoop?$

$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Chorus again!M-bM-^@M-^] cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun$
to repeat it, when a cry of M-bM-^@M-^\The trialM-bM-^@M-^Ys beginning!M-bM-^@M-^] was heard in the$
distance.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Come on!M-bM-^@M-^] cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried$
off, without waiting for the end of the song.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What trial is it?M-bM-^@M-^] Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only$
answered M-bM-^@M-^\Come on!M-bM-^@M-^] and ran the faster, while more and more faintly$
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:M-bM-^@M-^T$

CHAPTER XI.$
Who Stole the Tarts?$
$
$
The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they$
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about themM-bM-^@M-^Tall sorts of little$
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was$
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard$
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one$
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the$
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so$
good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\I wish theyM-bM-^@M-^Yd$
get the trial done,M-bM-^@M-^] she thought, M-bM-^@M-^\and hand round the refreshments!M-bM-^@M-^]$
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at$
everything about her, to pass away the time.$
$
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read$
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew$
the name of nearly everything there. M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the judge,M-bM-^@M-^] she said to$
herself, M-bM-^@M-^\because of his great wig.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the$
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he$
did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the jury-box,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice, M-bM-^@M-^\and those twelve creatures,M-bM-^@M-^]$
(she was obliged to say M-bM-^@M-^\creatures,M-bM-^@M-^] you see, because some of them were$
animals, and some were birds,) M-bM-^@M-^\I suppose they are the jurors.M-bM-^@M-^] She$
said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather$
proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little$
girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, M-bM-^@M-^\jury-menM-bM-^@M-^]$
would have done just as well.$
$
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. M-bM-^@M-^\What are$
they doing?M-bM-^@M-^] Alice whispered to the Gryphon. M-bM-^@M-^\They canM-bM-^@M-^Yt have anything$
to put down yet, before the trialM-bM-^@M-^Ys begun.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\TheyM-bM-^@M-^Yre putting down their names,M-bM-^@M-^] the Gryphon whispered in reply,$
M-bM-^@M-^\for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Stupid things!M-bM-^@M-^] Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she$
stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, M-bM-^@M-^\Silence in the$
court!M-bM-^@M-^] and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,$
to make out who was talking.$
$
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,$
that all the jurors were writing down M-bM-^@M-^\stupid things!M-bM-^@M-^] on their slates,$
and she could even make out that one of them didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt know how to spell$
M-bM-^@M-^\stupid,M-bM-^@M-^] and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. M-bM-^@M-^\A nice$
muddle their slatesM-bM-^@M-^Yll be in before the trialM-bM-^@M-^Ys over!M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice.$
$
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice$
could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and$
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly$
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out$
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he$
was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this$
was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Herald, read the accusation!M-bM-^@M-^] said the King.$
$
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then$
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,$
    All on a summer day:$
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,$
    And took them quite away!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Consider your verdict,M-bM-^@M-^] the King said to the jury.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not yet, not yet!M-bM-^@M-^] the Rabbit hastily interrupted. M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys a great$
deal to come before that!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Call the first witness,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King; and the White Rabbit blew$
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, M-bM-^@M-^\First witness!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand$
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. M-bM-^@M-^\I beg pardon, your$
Majesty,M-bM-^@M-^] he began, M-bM-^@M-^\for bringing these in: but I hadnM-bM-^@M-^Yt quite finished$
my tea when I was sent for.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You ought to have finished,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King. M-bM-^@M-^\When did you begin?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the$
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. M-bM-^@M-^\Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it$
was,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Fifteenth,M-bM-^@M-^] said the March Hare.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sixteenth,M-bM-^@M-^] added the Dormouse.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Write that down,M-bM-^@M-^] the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly$
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and$
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Take off your hat,M-bM-^@M-^] the King said to the Hatter.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt mine,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_Stolen!_M-bM-^@M-^] the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made$
a memorandum of the fact.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I keep them to sell,M-bM-^@M-^] the Hatter added as an explanation; M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve none$
of my own. IM-bM-^@M-^Ym a hatter.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,$
who turned pale and fidgeted.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Give your evidence,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King; M-bM-^@M-^\and donM-bM-^@M-^Yt be nervous, or IM-bM-^@M-^Yll$
have you executed on the spot.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting$
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his$
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the$
bread-and-butter.$
$
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled$
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to$
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave$
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was$
as long as there was room for her.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wish you wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt squeeze so.M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dormouse, who was sitting$
next to her. M-bM-^@M-^\I can hardly breathe.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt help it,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice very meekly: M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym growing.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve no right to grow _here_,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dormouse.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt talk nonsense,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice more boldly: M-bM-^@M-^\you know youM-bM-^@M-^Yre growing$
too.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Dormouse: M-bM-^@M-^\not in$
that ridiculous fashion.M-bM-^@M-^] And he got up very sulkily and crossed over$
to the other side of the court.$
$
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,$
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers$
of the court, M-bM-^@M-^\Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!M-bM-^@M-^]$
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes$
off.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Give your evidence,M-bM-^@M-^] the King repeated angrily, M-bM-^@M-^\or IM-bM-^@M-^Yll have you$
executed, whether youM-bM-^@M-^Yre nervous or not.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym a poor man, your Majesty,M-bM-^@M-^] the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tand I hadnM-bM-^@M-^Yt begun my teaM-bM-^@M-^Tnot above a week or soM-bM-^@M-^Tand what with the$
bread-and-butter getting so thinM-bM-^@M-^Tand the twinkling of the teaM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The twinkling of the _what?_M-bM-^@M-^] said the King.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It _began_ with the tea,M-bM-^@M-^] the Hatter replied.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course twinkling begins with a T!M-bM-^@M-^] said the King sharply. M-bM-^@M-^\Do you$
take me for a dunce? Go on!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym a poor man,M-bM-^@M-^] the Hatter went on, M-bM-^@M-^\and most things twinkled after$

$
M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt!M-bM-^@M-^] the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You did!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I deny it!M-bM-^@M-^] said the March Hare.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He denies it,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King: M-bM-^@M-^\leave out that part.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, at any rate, the Dormouse saidM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] the Hatter went on, looking$
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied$
nothing, being fast asleep.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\After that,M-bM-^@M-^] continued the Hatter, M-bM-^@M-^\I cut some more bread-and-butterM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But what did the Dormouse say?M-bM-^@M-^] one of the jury asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt remember,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You _must_ remember,M-bM-^@M-^] remarked the King, M-bM-^@M-^\or IM-bM-^@M-^Yll have you executed.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went$
down on one knee. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym a poor man, your Majesty,M-bM-^@M-^] he began.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre a _very_ poor _speaker_,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King.$
$
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by$
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just$
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied$
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,$
head first, and then sat upon it.)$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym glad IM-bM-^@M-^Yve seen that done,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve so often read in$

applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the$
court,M-bM-^@M-^] and I never understood what it meant till now.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys all you know about it, you may stand down,M-bM-^@M-^] continued the$
King.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt go no lower,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter: M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym on the floor, as it is.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then you may _sit_ down,M-bM-^@M-^] the King replied.$
$
Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!M-bM-^@M-^] thought Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\Now we shall get$
on better.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yd rather finish my tea,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Hatter, with an anxious look at$
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You may go,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,$
without even waiting to put his shoes on.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tand just take his head off outside,M-bM-^@M-^] the Queen added to one of the$
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get$
to the door.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Call the next witness!M-bM-^@M-^] said the King.$
$
The next witness was the DuchessM-bM-^@M-^Ys cook. She carried the pepper-box in$
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the$
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Give your evidence,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ShanM-bM-^@M-^Yt,M-bM-^@M-^] said the cook.$
$
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,$
M-bM-^@M-^\Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, if I must, I must,M-bM-^@M-^] the King said, with a melancholy air, and,$
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were$
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, M-bM-^@M-^\What are tarts made of?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Pepper, mostly,M-bM-^@M-^] said the cook.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Treacle,M-bM-^@M-^] said a sleepy voice behind her.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Collar that Dormouse,M-bM-^@M-^] the Queen shrieked out. M-bM-^@M-^\Behead that Dormouse!$
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his$
whiskers!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse$
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had$
disappeared.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Never mind!M-bM-^@M-^] said the King, with an air of great relief. M-bM-^@M-^\Call the$
next witness.M-bM-^@M-^] And he added in an undertone to the Queen, M-bM-^@M-^\Really, my$
dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my$
forehead ache!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling$
very curious to see what the next witness would be like, M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^Tfor they$
havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt got much evidence _yet_,M-bM-^@M-^] she said to herself. Imagine her$
surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill$
little voice, the name M-bM-^@M-^\Alice!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$

$
CHAPTER XII.$
AliceM-bM-^@M-^Ys Evidence$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Here!M-bM-^@M-^] cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how$
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such$
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,$
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there$
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of$
goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!M-bM-^@M-^] she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and$
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident$
of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of$
idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the$
jury-box, or they would die.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The trial cannot proceed,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King in a very grave voice, M-bM-^@M-^\until$
all the jurymen are back in their proper placesM-bM-^@M-^T_all_,M-bM-^@M-^] he repeated$
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.$
$
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put$
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its$
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon$
got it out again, and put it right; M-bM-^@M-^\not that it signifies much,M-bM-^@M-^] she$
said to herself; M-bM-^@M-^\I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the$
trial one way up as the other.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being$
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to$
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the$
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do$
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the$
court.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What do you know about this business?M-bM-^@M-^] the King said to Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Nothing,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Nothing _whatever?_M-bM-^@M-^] persisted the King.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Nothing whatever,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys very important,M-bM-^@M-^] the King said, turning to the jury. They were$
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White$
Rabbit interrupted: M-bM-^@M-^\_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,M-bM-^@M-^] he$
said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as$
he spoke.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_Un_important, of course, I meant,M-bM-^@M-^] the King hastily said, and went on$
to himself in an undertone,$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\importantM-bM-^@M-^TunimportantM-bM-^@M-^TunimportantM-bM-^@M-^TimportantM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] as if he were trying$
which word sounded best.$
$
Some of the jury wrote it down M-bM-^@M-^\important,M-bM-^@M-^] and some M-bM-^@M-^\unimportant.M-bM-^@M-^]$
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;$
M-bM-^@M-^\but it doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt matter a bit,M-bM-^@M-^] she thought to herself.$
$
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in$
his note-book, cackled out M-bM-^@M-^\Silence!M-bM-^@M-^] and read out from his book, M-bM-^@M-^\Rule$
Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Everybody looked at Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_IM-bM-^@M-^Ym_ not a mile high,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You are,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Nearly two miles high,M-bM-^@M-^] added the Queen.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, I shanM-bM-^@M-^Yt go, at any rate,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice: M-bM-^@M-^\besides, thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys not a$
regular rule: you invented it just now.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys the oldest rule in the book,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then it ought to be Number One,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. M-bM-^@M-^\Consider your$
verdict,M-bM-^@M-^] he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,M-bM-^@M-^] said the$
White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; M-bM-^@M-^\this paper has just been$
picked up.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\WhatM-bM-^@M-^Ys in it?M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt opened it yet,M-bM-^@M-^] said the White Rabbit, M-bM-^@M-^\but it seems to be a$
letter, written by the prisoner toM-bM-^@M-^Tto somebody.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It must have been that,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King, M-bM-^@M-^\unless it was written to$
nobody, which isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt usual, you know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Who is it directed to?M-bM-^@M-^] said one of the jurymen.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt directed at all,M-bM-^@M-^] said the White Rabbit; M-bM-^@M-^\in fact, thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
nothing written on the _outside_.M-bM-^@M-^] He unfolded the paper as he spoke,$
and added M-bM-^@M-^\It isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt a letter, after all: itM-bM-^@M-^Ys a set of verses.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Are they in the prisonerM-bM-^@M-^Ys handwriting?M-bM-^@M-^] asked another of the jurymen.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre not,M-bM-^@M-^] said the White Rabbit, M-bM-^@M-^\and thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the queerest$
thing about it.M-bM-^@M-^] (The jury all looked puzzled.)$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He must have imitated somebody elseM-bM-^@M-^Ys hand,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King. (The jury$
all brightened up again.)$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Please your Majesty,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Knave, M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt write it, and they$
canM-bM-^@M-^Yt prove I did: thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no name signed at the end.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If you didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt sign it,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King, M-bM-^@M-^\that only makes the matter$
worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else youM-bM-^@M-^Yd have signed$
your name like an honest man.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really$
clever thing the King had said that day.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That _proves_ his guilt,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It proves nothing of the sort!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice. M-bM-^@M-^\Why, you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt even know$
what theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre about!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Read them,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King.$
$
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. M-bM-^@M-^\Where shall I begin, please$
your Majesty?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Begin at the beginning,M-bM-^@M-^] the King said gravely, M-bM-^@M-^\and go on till you$
come to the end: then stop.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
These were the verses the White Rabbit read:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\They told me you had been to her,$
    And mentioned me to him:$
She gave me a good character,$
    But said I could not swim.$
$
He sent them word I had not gone$
    (We know it to be true):$
If she should push the matter on,$
    What would become of you?$
$
I gave her one, they gave him two,$
    You gave us three or more;$
They all returned from him to you,$
    Though they were mine before.$
$
If I or she should chance to be$
    Involved in this affair,$
He trusts to you to set them free,$
    Exactly as we were.$
$
My notion was that you had been$
    (Before she had this fit)$
An obstacle that came between$
    Him, and ourselves, and it.$
$
DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt let him know she liked them best,$
    For this must ever be$
A secret, kept from all the rest,$
    Between yourself and me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the most important piece of evidence weM-bM-^@M-^Yve heard yet,M-bM-^@M-^] said the$
King, rubbing his hands; M-bM-^@M-^\so now let the juryM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If any one of them can explain it,M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, (she had grown so$
large in the last few minutes that she wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt a bit afraid of$
interrupting him,) M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll give him sixpence. _I_ donM-bM-^@M-^Yt believe thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
an atom of meaning in it.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The jury all wrote down on their slates, M-bM-^@M-^\_She_ doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt believe thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
an atom of meaning in it,M-bM-^@M-^] but none of them attempted to explain the$
paper.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no meaning in it,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King, M-bM-^@M-^\that saves a world of$
trouble, you know, as we neednM-bM-^@M-^Yt try to find any. And yet I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
know,M-bM-^@M-^] he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at$
them with one eye; M-bM-^@M-^\I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^T_said I could not swim_M-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] you canM-bM-^@M-^Yt swim, can you?M-bM-^@M-^] he added, turning$
to the Knave.$
$
The Knave shook his head sadly. M-bM-^@M-^\Do I look like it?M-bM-^@M-^] he said. (Which he$
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\All right, so far,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King, and he went on muttering over the$
verses to himself: M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^X_We know it to be true_M-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^Y thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the jury, of$
courseM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^X_I gave her one, they gave him two_M-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^Y why, that must be what he$
did with the tarts, you knowM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But, it goes on M-bM-^@M-^X_they all returned from him to you_,M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why, there they are!M-bM-^@M-^] said the King triumphantly, pointing to the$
tarts on the table. M-bM-^@M-^\Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then$
againM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^X_before she had this fit_M-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^Y you never had fits, my dear, I$
think?M-bM-^@M-^] he said to the Queen.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Never!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard$
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his$
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily$
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long$
as it lasted.)$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then the words donM-bM-^@M-^Yt _fit_ you,M-bM-^@M-^] said the King, looking round the$
court with a smile. There was a dead silence.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys a pun!M-bM-^@M-^] the King added in an offended tone, and everybody$
laughed, M-bM-^@M-^\Let the jury consider their verdict,M-bM-^@M-^] the King said, for$
about the twentieth time that day.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, no!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen. M-bM-^@M-^\Sentence firstM-bM-^@M-^Tverdict afterwards.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Stuff and nonsense!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice loudly. M-bM-^@M-^\The idea of having the$
sentence first!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Hold your tongue!M-bM-^@M-^] said the Queen, turning purple.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Off with her head!M-bM-^@M-^] the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody$
moved.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Who cares for you?M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by$
this time.) M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre nothing but a pack of cards!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon$
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and$
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her$
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead$
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Wake up, Alice dear!M-bM-^@M-^] said her sister; M-bM-^@M-^\Why, what a long sleep youM-bM-^@M-^Yve$
had!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, IM-bM-^@M-^Yve had such a curious dream!M-bM-^@M-^] said Alice, and she told her$
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange$
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she$
had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, M-bM-^@M-^\It _was_ a curious$
dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; itM-bM-^@M-^Ys getting late.M-bM-^@M-^]$
So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,$
what a wonderful dream it had been.$
$
$
But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her$
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all$
her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,$
and this was her dream:M-bM-^@M-^T$
$
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny$
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were$
looking up into hersM-bM-^@M-^Tshe could hear the very tones of her voice, and$
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair$
that _would_ always get into her eyesM-bM-^@M-^Tand still as she listened, or$
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the$
strange creatures of her little sisterM-bM-^@M-^Ys dream.$
$
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried byM-bM-^@M-^Tthe$
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolM-bM-^@M-^Tshe$
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends$
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen$
ordering off her unfortunate guests to executionM-bM-^@M-^Tonce more the pig-baby$
was sneezing on the DuchessM-bM-^@M-^Ys knee, while plates and dishes crashed$
around itM-bM-^@M-^Tonce more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the$
LizardM-bM-^@M-^Ys slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,$
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock$
Turtle.$
$
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in$
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all$
would change to dull realityM-bM-^@M-^Tthe grass would be only rustling in the$
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsM-bM-^@M-^Tthe rattling$
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the QueenM-bM-^@M-^Ys shrill$
cries to the voice of the shepherd boyM-bM-^@M-^Tand the sneeze of the baby, the$
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change$
(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yardM-bM-^@M-^Twhile the$
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock$
TurtleM-bM-^@M-^Ys heavy sobs.$
$
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers$
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would$
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her$
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,$
and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,$
perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she$
would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all$
their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer$
days.$

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm$
$
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of$
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of$
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It$
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations$
from people in all walks of life.$
$
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the$
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's$
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will$
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project$
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure$
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future$
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary$
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see$
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at$
www.gutenberg.org$
$

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the$
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal$
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification$
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary$
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by$
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.$

$
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg$
Literary Archive Foundation$
$
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without$
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of$
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be$
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest$
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations$
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt$
status with the IRS.$
$
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating$
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United$
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a$
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up$
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations$
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND$
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular$
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate$
$
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we$
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition$
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who$
approach us with offers to donate.$
$
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make$
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from$
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.$
$
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation$
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other$
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To$
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate$
$
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works$
$
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project$
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be$
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and$
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of$
volunteer support.$
$
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed$
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in$
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not$
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper$
edition.$
$
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search$
facility: www.gutenberg.org$
$
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,$
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary$
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to$
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.$
